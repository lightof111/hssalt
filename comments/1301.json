interested in any game  Waiting for virtual reality to get cheaper i hope it will bring sth new and fascinating as I cant put up playing HS for longer than 1 5 hour  About the RNG in this game  I said many times  There is some good rng involved which i dont care about because it doesnt annoy me like rolling SD totem  flameweaker killing your board  overall things that can be predicted  And there is this RNG which makes me close Hearthstone straight away and be pissed off for atleast 10 minutes after shit happens  Yogg saron winning game straight away  cabalist tome picking up good removals for mage  priest thoughtstealing your best cards and stealing your threats  About arena  people who play arena are actually bored of constructed or newbies wanting to play random card because arena is the most bullshit and random thing in HS  I actually did the same with HS  I uninstalled it like 2 months ago but then reinstalled it on a weekend  Just take a break for a week or two and try to find other way to look at fucked up RNG because this game CAN and WILL ruin your mood\", \"commentId\": \"27289\", \"commentDate\": \"1477383333\"}, {\"comment\": \"Exactly if you switch to other deck you

still use this thing and perfect curved every turn  I made some really good answers but to no redemption since he was topdecking the answer   everything wrong with Hearthstone in just one game    If

that matchmaking is rigged i think i read once even reynad himself said that after a certain amounts of win you will get bad matchups until you lose and why if i lost 3 games in a row i get to play against an easy deck example control warrior i get freeze mage that also happens atleast to me im getting tired of ppl constantly mocking you for thinking outside of the box are you sucking blizz dick
