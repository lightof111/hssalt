running Hungry Crab even though there is literally one strong murloc deck and its not even that common at this time of day  lost so many needless games  had to switch back to PW from Paladin to get legend and was 1 win from legend like 34 times  what a complete waste of my time  this game is still completely RNG dependent  with terribly designed cards like Golakka Crawler  Hungry Crab and Gluttonous Ooze that just cheese aggro matchups but means you autolose to decks that arent vulnerable to them  hosers are making this game even less skill dependent  why does Blizzard think that counterarchetype cards are the answer Next expansion we will probably see 1 mana 22 Destroy an Elemental gain 55 just because LUL   design philosophy is completely broken  pretty much all the new cards are way too powerful and do too much  preNaxx if you changed some of the bullshit cards was perfectly fine but nope  have to introduce OP new cards which makes the game more RNG dependent just to make more   this game is a sad piece of garbage and I hope that my masters degree application gets accepted so I can get a new PC and play games that are actually fun and skilldependent rather than

crab paladin would be a lot stronger  without gluttonous ooze pirate warrior would be a lot stronger  They make so that if you keep losing to strong decks you can actually do something to actively counter them  And they definitely dont make you autolose matchups that arent vulnerable to them  Just because you have 1 mana 12s  2 mana 23s or 3 mana 33s in your deck doesnt mean you autolose  And

{\"comment\": \"The way to make PW less dominant is to directly nerf PW cards and synergies  Patches is way too strong and was a mistake  NZoths first mate gives you a 13 weapon and a 11 which is way too much value  but it really is Patches that makes the deck completely broken  winrate drops a lot when Patches ends up in your opening hand  Blizzard trying to rectify this by inserting other cards just makes it a rockpaperscissors game instead of involving any mechanical or deckbuilding skill  if you see too much PW on ladder  just put this 23 in your deck  And you might not draw it at all  which means you lose anyway  the problem is that PW is too strong  giving people a tool to combat it is not the right answer  downright nerfing PW is  PWPaladin being too strong may not be healthy for the meta  but introducing cards that give you a large chance of autowinning against them  but only if you draw them and run into them on ladder  reduces the game to an RNGfilled rockpaperscissors simulator  If classes are too strong compared to others because of a certain deck archetype  then that archetype should be nerfed directly instead of inserting some bespoke solution   This is a good article on hosers in MtG although Ive never played Magic httpmagic wizards comenarticlesarchivemakingmagicenemymine20020218 Golakka Crawler for example is a 23  which is standard for 2 mana  On the one hand  if it eats a pirate  it is overstatted and is way too strong  but then again a standard 23 is too weak in the current meta to occupy a 2mana slot  because every card is so powerful nowadays  and you lose to someone running a strictly better 2mana card every time  all things equal  Blizzard did a good job of fixing this problem by removing Azure Drake and Ragnaros from standard play  for example  which was the right way to go about things  If the average power level of cards were to go down  Crawler could become a 22 and have the same effect  just like Hungry Crab being a 12 being wellbalanced back in release because of its base cost and effect compared to other 1mana cards  it was a real risk you took running the card  So   Golakka Crawler is overstatted If you draw it against PW you autowin  but only if you draw it If you dont draw it you lose to PW  most likely If you draw it against a nonpirate deck  you most likely lose because a normal 23 still sucks compared to other 2drops power level of other 2drops is too high PW is too strong and should indeed be nerfed  not by introducing a hoser which is just lazy and bad game design decks in HS are too small  games are fast and too draw dependent  but by nerfing PWs cards or cycling them out of standard play  Yes PW is broken  but so is Crawler  and it makes the game even less skilldependent than it already is  Playing a broken deck and abusing it is the most logical step I can take to reduce RNG on ladder and climb fastest\", \"commentId\": \"37254\", \"commentDate\": \"1494681784\"}, {\"comment\": \"I cant kill you

win from legend earlier today with Paladin and ran into a bunch of Hungry Crab decks  so I switched to PW to farm them and it worked  since PW punishes them for bad tech choices the most  plus I get to jam the largest number of games in  The larger the sample size  the more my winrate tends to 6570  Since I was playing against Golakka Crawler spammers earlier in the morning today  I spent all of my dust on Paladin legendaries and climbed from rank 3 3 stars  where I had dropped to with PW  all the way to rank 1 5 stars  before the Hungry Crab wall dropped me back to rank 1 1 star  PW was then
