self respect and originality and joined the cancerfest of the current meta  To me their rank means nothing  They get squelched  Dont give me well played when your autopilot shit deck rolls over to its win  Just feel embarrassed that you are the same rank as me playing that bullshit  Fucking weenies  Honestly another pirate warrior  Renoanything  or Shaman deck running the exact same decklist I think Im actually going to puke  Liberal amounts of rope and BM  if I pull off a win over your OP shit because I cant give you the horsewhipping you deserve  Double the BM and even less respect for

people for playing reno when its basically the only way you can have a balanced match with someone  Im serious  find me a way that you can have even a 40  winrate in the current meta playing priest or warlock without reno  Youre directing your anger at the wrong people  Reno decks are played as a reaction to the cancer meta  you cant even group it with shaman and warrior players whore the reason people have to use these decks if they want to be able to play the game without having to instaconcede as soon as they see warrior or shaman  Also  why dont you mention rogue Going up against a board with multiple 552020 stealth minions is just as fucking boring as losing to pirate warrior on turn 4\", \"commentId\": \"31898\", \"commentDate\": \"1486179597\"}, {\"comment\": \"You me have already

a warlock without Reno to rank 12 last season  Your belief that you have to play a top tier netdeck to compete is typical thinking for 99 and the reason we are drowning in an endless sea of the same  decks  especially Renoloc reno Mage reno priest pirate warrior dragon priest Jade Shaman and yes Miracle Rogue  Its beyond pathetic that you will see nothing but those decks on ladder even at beginning ranks    ffs my homebrew warloc just lost to a Renoloc at rank 20he had all the cards and knew exactly how to play it  Do I respect him  nope  Its boring and brain dead  I can build any deck I want  but theres no point  a bot can play them  The hard out netdecking used to start around ranks 1210  If people are going to take a shot at legend and want to grind the most efficient decks its understandable you would see a concentration of them high up on the ladder  but the current state of the ladder game is vomit inducing starting at rank 25\", \"commentId\": \"31901\", \"commentDate\":
