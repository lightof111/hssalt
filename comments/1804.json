on grinding but my best this season is rank 18    I just dont know what to do  Ive been playing heartstone for about year and a half and i think im not that bad of a player but i just get ran over by rng  Like when the guys last card is mctech and he steals my lightlord on my full board to heal himself out of my lethal or my own yogg Pyroblasting my face after summoning Malygos from free from amber  I just dont know what im doing wrong  Im taking a record of how many topdecks my oponets got that won them the gamesaved them from lethal and currently im on 47  Im serisouly thinking of quiting this game  Any advices\", \"commentId\": \"37828\", \"commentDate\": \"1495481756\"}, {\"comment\": \"I am playing Wild since last month just to give it a go  Overall it is fun for the most part as most of the players play random decks and there is this element of surprise where you cant guess every single card on your opponents deck  However  from time to time I meet the good old RNGcasino decks  I played against a mage who managed to play 5 kabalist tomes and after countless spells she played Yogg who after 7 minutes of casting spells destroyed all my defences and lost me the game  Seriously fuck this game    I was just there watching   No interaction at all  Even if I survived Yogg  he was kind enough to put three more copies of himself in the mages deck just to be safe\", \"commentId\": \"37829\", \"commentDate\": \"1495482076\"}, {\"comment\": \"So  today I played 12 games with my worthless warlock deck at rank 5  9 encounters were mages 9 encounters were mages 9 of them won because warlock has 0  repeating  0 chance to win against this class  all mages run the same value aka discoverrandomstuffanddelaythegame stuff  When I was lucky to get ahead on board  literally perfect discovers into the exact cards that lost me the game  Mage in 2k17 is just so unfair  it has more taunt than warrior  more face than hunter  more card draw than rogue  more insertwhatever than warlock  Stop playing this bullshait retarded deck pls     Foremost  how are you still rank 5 with that retarded piece of a deck Getabrain\", \"commentId\": \"37830\",
