polymorph  2 mana wyrms and 2 32 spell damage  Which are some of the best minions to have as tempo mage   a fireland portal and a fireball  The problem isnt they drew tempo mage card  the problem is they drew basically the best of their deck in record time  As a control deck  nothing I had could ever stick  and I was getting pumelled by massive amounts of snowball minions and burn  The last 3

forgot to mention that they just randomly start throwing spells into your face at round 6 if you have 20 life or not doesnt matter since they do it anyway  Because their stupid mage mind tells them haha it worked 10 times why wouldnt it work this time again   or they just fireball your 34 round 4 to push 5 more dmg with their op 1 drop in  wait the opponent can actually remove it no way but i

possible or just try to farm badnew players  No one wants to try new decks  really  Thats also obviously because of the base design of the game  Mistake piled onto mistake  You have to remember that the design team for this game is fabulously clueless and incompetent and fixing casual is not something they care about  What they want is to make money by attempting to turn HS into an esport They did make a game thats fun to watch  but the game is so random that no one can really be good at it  so theyre doomed to fail in that respect Anyway  yah  dont waste your time in casual for testing decks  just go into ranked  At least if you win games you get like   gold hero points  wow  lol\", \"commentId\": \"28074\", \"commentDate\": \"1479524872\"}, {\"comment\": \"watching some streams of
