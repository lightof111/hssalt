no way it will perform this well  You will just keep dropping low minions and you lose  but Blizzard rigged it so that you always pull cards like Savannah highmane and COW every time on Curve   Other aggro decks like shamans  warlocks and warriors have a lot of draw power  so their hands are full of good minions because of it  but why hunters have the same powerlevel without card draw  rigged\",
