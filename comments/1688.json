minion that I had to leave up for 1 turn  Tripple Rockbiter Windfury or something like that  Or another game where a Shaman coined out Nerubian Egg into Nerubian Egg and I knew he had Flametongue but what am I supposed to do  never play a Minion and just let him develop more Im not wasting my gold on that   Thanks  Reading all other peoples rage makes me a little happier \", \"commentId\":

between the two HFBy the two HF I mean to have fun and to have a Fk Why Because I strongly think we are getting this all wrong  There is no meta in HS  there is no concept at all of meta when you have mechanics like discover or discount  or summon this or that  I really enjoy HS  play as much as I can  but I mean  you have  mages playing more than 50 cards without even running out of cards in the deck 4 iceblocks  3 ice barriers  just stuid stuff you have 3 Kalimos Shamans with no costo to its inmense effects ie  health cost  reflect or sumthing like that infinite Operatives value still viable Miracle Priests  which controls anything and thanks God entomb is gone A rotated out Ragnaros  that comes back in the shape of an unstopable hero power TIER ONE PIRATE WARRIOS  DUDE JUST F NERF THOSE JOY KILLAS turn 4 quest rogues  no quest wlock  no quest palas oh yeah  reno gone but hell  why rotate out him if we can bring him back as a priestonly badass girlu Just cut the crap of infinite value decks man  Its just not fun  I wish we had other endgames in HS  I am thinking open cups or finding a comunity to play tournaments  cuz Im sick of this sht\", \"commentId\": \"35432\",
