statistics  and it is unreal that Im not even close to winning every second 5050  And if it was only the 5050s  but every single other RNG element as well  be it curves  topdecks  or losing to almost nonexisting odds  The only day last season when I wasnt unluckier than my opponents  I ended up in Top 10 Legend  But for the rest  how am I supposed to beat TroggGolem 9 out of 10 times  when neither do I get a good curves nor have I mediocre luck Im stuck at rank 56 now   get it  I could make it to top 10 legend 1 day before the end of the season  but I can barely get to rank 5 in this one  Must have forgotten to play  rightSeriously  Im not saying my opponents play bad  or I dont get lucky sometimes  but the odds just dont add up in the long run  Obviously as Im writing this down  I lost a game to 2 topdecks in a row\", \"commentId\": \"27620\", \"commentDate\": \"1478362474\"}, {\"comment\": \"Holy fuck  enemy rag can hit face when you got 7 minions on board and my own obviously hits

pally  a spell mage and a beastdragon midrange druid pimped up with the curator and a few tempo cards  Tested them a few times and they worked great in casual  But no  mercilessly pushed down to 20 by face decks  The final straw was a golden druid with a deck consisting half of basic cards that roped every single turn until i had to leave for work  I dont know how normal players that dont play aggro or shammy make it anywhere up the ladder  Not talking to you 16000 dust warrior    Guess ill just rebuild that garbage overload brann shammy  it was at least broken enough to make it to 12 last time with minimal effort and without things from below  totem golems or spirit claws and just one doomhammer  I guess i giggled a few times brann rolled forth a 126  buffed it to 166  then followed by a crushing 16 damage from the hammer\", \"commentId\": \"27622\", \"commentDate\": \"1478364368\"}, {\"comment\": \"blizzard just reprint all the op card  priest and paladin gain power again  why so
