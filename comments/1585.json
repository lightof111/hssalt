decks  such as mid jade shaman  dragon priest and warrior  miracle rogue  pirate warrior and others  I understand concepts like board control  mana efficiency  card advantage and yet I cant go past rank 1413 at the moment  my best being rank 7 when I was spamming pirate warrior before the nerfs  I feel like I deserve a better rank because  for example  I have a 100 win rate  7  0  against shaman playing as shaman  so I think Im better than people at this rank  And always happens the same thing  I start with a win streak of 70 and then I just start losing a lot of games and suddenly it seems like the meta is full of unfavourable matchups  so I chance decks based on the matchup  I get 2 or 3 wins and then only unfavourable matchups Im really pissed off  I dont know why I like this game so

motherfucker topdecks a holy nova on turn 5  jeez i got outskilled so hard shoulda played around a retarded topdeck  I still have no clue if its the proper play but as im playing a zoo deck  its essential to take risks with soulfire and holding two cards  one being a silverware golem  but noooooooooooooooooooooooo why do i bother going for it cause im gonna lose the other card anyways  then lose out on tempo i understand losing some 5050s but this bullshit happens at least 4 of 5 times  i hate this game edit i forgot to mention that after i clear out cards while mulliganing  i draw both doomguards    hello i run 2 5 drops thats literally the highest mana card i have what do you mean not to mention drawing both of them really whats the point of mulliganing if im gonna draw the highest

able to achieve a high rank yet you tend to lookl up to the tank 10 and lower gamers   IIt feels like climbing the ladder from rank 15 to 10 is the hardest part  Going from 105 seems to go way faster  Both ranges are a lot of fun and you cant really tell that your playing higher rank  Winning at rank 8 is so much easier then you would expect when you never experienced it before  Winning at rank 16 feels rather similar  The difference is in little details\", \"commentId\": \"33307\", \"commentDate\": \"1488953280\"}, {\"comment\": \"The game sucks hard at the moment at every rank if you are not happy to play Shaman  pirate warrior  Jade Druid  Dragon Priest or Renokafukus  Brode and his team have really turned this game into a giant fucking pile of netdecking suckage  Time to check out Gwent and some other games I think  I urge everyone else to do the same  Much as I despise Lifecoachs slow play style he at least has seen through the bullshit to tell it like it is  Ladder on Hearthstone is a joke  Krip has said much the same  Leave the game or at the very least make sure you NEVER give Blizzard money while the game lurches from one broken set of unbalanced cards to another  The only thing thats kept me here through Secret Wankadin  Aggro Shaman  Cthun Armor Warrior  Pirates and JadeDragon Priest Bullshit has been the challenge of finding off meta decks to ladder with  but thats now very difficult and its boring as fuck to face the same decks again and again and again  Been playing 3 hours today and mainly Ive faced Reno Mage  and Jade Druid with some tempo Mage midrange Shaman and Dragon Priest in between  No variety in any of the decks  seen them all literally hundreds of times each  One evolve Shaman  hardly original  Boring as fuck  Opponents clearly have no selfrespect  they just want to win and drop BM emotes  No autosquelch  No penalty for roping  The game sucks and sucks hard  I think the only people having fun are in the main very new players riding cancer decks or veterans who love grinding OP netdecks  if you want to try using your established card collection without playing a so called metadeck you had better enjoy losing to bad mannered Shamans  Jade Druid with auctioneers  dragon priests with drakonid  and  Reno mages\", \"commentId\": \"33308\", \"commentDate\": \"1488957866\"}, {\"comment\": \"Arena is rigged beyond belief  I just
