fatigue  theyre down to one card in hand  and Im sitting comfortably with 15 HP  10 cards in the deck  a few in hand  an Ysera and a Black Knight on board that I intend to Master of Evolution    They play Yogg  it destroys my entire board  plays CotW  Soul of the Forest on top of it  Forgotten Torch on my face  thus also preventing one fatigue draw  And giving another 6 damage   Amongst other things  of course  like having a paladin secret  upgrading their weapon into a 22 from a 11  all that more mundane stuff  I can only Ysera Awakens  Thus getting me pretty low in HP   play SenJin  which will get cleared by the Roaring Torch anyway    Yup  lost      Even had to wait for it to play my Healing Wave since they played 3 Skeleton Knight  Gotten from Journey Below  and only not returned to hand more because I finally silenced it  thanks to pulling their Auctioneer twice against my lowest drops \", \"commentId\": \"22671\", \"commentDate\": \"1468372715\"}, {\"comment\": \"If
