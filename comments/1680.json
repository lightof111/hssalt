for today  In a game against a mage I managed to steal a Firelands Portal  Good times  I then proceed to kill a minion with it only to summon Starving Buzzard  Well fuck me  Later in the same game I played Free From Amber with Atiesh up  I got Deathwing and     Anomalus  Thx  I also tried a Lyra the Sunshard with 4 spells or something and got 2xPurify  Shadow Word Death that was nice and another garbage spell   In my next time I faced a quest Rogue that played Mimic Pod on turn 3  I told myself that hell probably draw Shadowstep and   yes  Needless to say the quest was quickly done   After a kind of bad luck streak I decided to try the brawl and test my luck and yes    I played 4 sixmana spells and got Fight Promotor  another garbage card and then    this happened see attachment   Ill stop playing for the rest of the day  \", \"commentId\": \"35257\", \"commentDate\": \"1492078079\"}, {\"comment\": \"I just won game in Arena but it got me loss anyway lol  great game blizzard\",
