blizzard and the warr who did 30 damage before turn 6 and kill me with reno in hand  told me well played at the end    what can i play well if he kill me before i manage to play reno how    this month

played about 10 games yesterday  4 Pirate Warriors  and 4 Rogues among them  I am really starting to get pissed off with Rogues even more than Pirate Warriors   The use of Questing Adventurer and various lowcost or no cost Rogue cards is completely unfair  Add to that Edwin VanCleef and these games become as stupid as Pirate Warrior face smash games  Oh look  this round I got out a card to counter this crap e g  Aldor Peacekeeper the next round I dont  If I dont  Im dead in 45 turns  If I do  I might have a shot at surviving    Is this really what the designers intended FFS  why do they not step in and do something Each class should be playable and no one should be totally FUBAR by round 4 or 5\", \"commentId\": \"31697\", \"commentDate\": \"1485811089\"}, {\"comment\": \"Man I wish they had some system to remove some random outcomes from some cards Like doomsayer  Doomsayers should never spawn from random effects like Shredders  It just completely wrecks the game when it happens  Like  literally as bad as just a disconnect  Same for MCTech triggers  basically  It just turns the game randomly upside down  Thats the same as your game just bugging out  Like WHOOPS THIS TURN YOUR ENTIRE HAND WAS DISCARDED DUE TO A BUG LEL TOO BAD  Thats the same feeling as when a Doomsayer spawns from like an evolve or a shredder\", \"commentId\": \"31698\", \"commentDate\": \"1485815572\"},
