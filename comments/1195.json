just the right cards to make me run out of steam and win  doesnt fail  Go from rank 1 to rank 5 in a day what a joke and then when you do play a real deck the Yogg wins through ridiculous RNG  What a waste of money and time this game is  you can have a 70 win rate all the way to Rank 2 but the minute you try and push for legend you get nothing but decks that counter you or kids that draw better\",

the usual Zoos and Aggro Shamans  I was starting to get pretty salty nonetheless  I kept playing and was matched against a Druid  Managed to beat him  but before I could actually win I got disconnected  Took a break and a few hours later the most fucking bullshit crap happened  I was matched against a Dragon Warrior who had a really aggressive start  but I did manage to get board control eventually  while still having a full hand  The guy was topdecking every single turn  getting all his big threats  like Gromm  Malkorok and so on  which I managed to deal with  Then  he topdecks fucking Deathwing  Im getting pretty low so I have to play Yogg  What happens Every single spell is draw including a freakin Starfire that kills my Yogg  then finishing with Astral Comunnion  With Deathwing fucking unharmed  What the fuck are the odds of being matched against a fucker who plays Deathwing  the fucker draws Dathwing  my Yogg doesnt kill Deathwing AND discards my entire hand  Mind you  if any of those 4 extremely unlikely outcomes didnt fucking happen  I would have fucking won that stupid game  The next fucking game I get matched against yet another fucking Druid and  sure enough  after a long fought battle with some ridiculous topdecks from him I manage to have the upper hand  only to get disconnected AGAIN for fucks sake  After a couple of hours  with the fucking internet showing no sign whatsoever  I get disconnected  Why the fuck dont these stupidass disconnects happen when Im up against a fucking Zoolock that goes first  or against that moron of a Warrior and his one in a billion chance of winning that stupid game  Man am I salty Fuck this game Screw it I already fucking uninstalled it Fucking piece of shit Im definitely taking a couple of weeks off before I return to this bullshit fucking game  if I even return  because  God knows  it hasnt been going fucking anywhere for years now  almost no new mechanics  just new RNG means of fucking your way
