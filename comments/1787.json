"[{\"comment\": \"Alright  steam blow time   Context I am one of the first people on the planet to reach wild legend this month  Now on the 16th I am still struggling on standard low ranks 5 to 1  Why Kripp just made a video about this Random  Yayeeawoofuck yes We are playing a game of randomness  A mechanic aimed at casuals has completely plagued competitive play  We have the most randomness ever and the skill required to perform well in this game drops at an alarming rate  Mage has  Primordial Glyph and Babbling Book  All that mage decks do nowadays is vomit their hand on the board and drag every possible spell face  Rogue has Swashburglar and Hallucination they either rely on both to win games or just go Quest  Paladin has Stonehill Defender which for some reason almost always discovers Legendaries  Oh  Priest They will steal your best cards with Crystalling Oracle  Curious Glimmerroot and Drakonid Operative   And if they dont run the control variant  Lyra will just clown fiesta for them  Warrior that is not Pirate Oh  they rely on Ragnaros hero power  Easy  Hunter has RNG to a lesser extent  but the Crackling Razormaw is the worst offender  Jeweled Macaw is a less volatile Babbling Book  but it creates a card that is impossible to play around  That makes it 7 out of 9 classes although control Shaman builds include Stonehil Defender now  With warlock being completely irrelevant  Is this the game we want to play Cut the randomness  Blizzard  give us one fucking expansion that rewards players with a brain k thx\", \"commentId\": \"37470\", \"commentDate\":

Hearthstone rely on skill Today we have alleycats into crackling razormaws and 2x shadowsteps and prep in opening hand  Before that we had SMB  into coin NZoth First Mate with Patches or in case of

games in a row with Pirate warrior  Mages with 4 ice blocks  Murloc paladinAggro druid killing you at turn 4 when you have only 34 drop minions in your hand  Control paladin  Warrior getting all the right cards  It just didnt matter what I did everything got countered  Today I came home and was like maybe it was just bad luck yesterday and I won 2 first games no problem  Then again my record today is 314    So basicly my record for past 2 days is 636  During this post I played 2 matches vs Midrange hunter  Didnt get a single 13 drop in either of those games and was at 1014hp at turn 4 without single weapon in hand  This is just fucking stupid  I mean there is like no bad plays or shit  I just cant do anything on board  Every card I play on board doesnt exist next turn but still they have developed something I need to respond  And I cant respond with anything because my hand is mostly minions  Using charger  mortal strike to remove one minion when you are 3 minions behind on board at turn 34 and losing the game in next 2 rounds if you dont finish it first or remove their whole board   Its just disgusting   I mean wtf Im supposed to do I played yesterday 12 games in a row without getting nzoth first mate or war axe in starting hand or before I was 100 to lose the game   Hearthstone is extremely fun competitive game \", \"commentId\": \"37477\", \"commentDate\":
