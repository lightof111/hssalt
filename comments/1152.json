the most damning proof Turn 2 in Heroic Its an aggro rng fest  its all this game is  Once you understand this  you will never be too angry again  Its a game made for fast decks with a lot of RNG  You want to play something slower find a different game  Know that the devs will never ever hear those complaints and they will always favor aggro\", \"commentId\": \"24082\", \"commentDate\":

things under control  then they die in one turn  Its just a different concept  different win condition  Sometimes you are dieing steadly from turn 1 aggro  sometimes in 12 turns combo  Sometimes you dont have any more resounrces and you die from either fat minions to the face or fatigue control  Thats how this works  The final result is always the same  Combo is a perfectly viable archetype  Want to beat it SMOrc them  Also  you generally dont control the board against combo  Thats an illusion  There is nothing to control  They are the ones who control and draw cards  Control player in this case sits back  because they dont have anything meaningful to control  See Priest when the class was very good vs freeze Mage  Good luck  Works as intended  \", \"commentId\": \"24089\",
