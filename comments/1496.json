pirate warrior player let me tell you I dont play that deck  I actually found it to be really inconsistent   Lets break this bullshit meta down though Streamers play basically nothing but Reno decks  bitch and moan about pirate warrior and Shaman decks  Here I am  I dont like playing pirate warrior  combo druid  and  I dont like playing Reno decks Yes I get it Mr  Streamer you get paid to sit there and play 30 minute games  but us little people dont actually get paid to play Hearthstone  and some of us dont enjoy 30 minute games that Reno decks and Jade Druid can lead to  So where does that leave me  Hunter decks  Oh  wait  I know how about an awesome buffadin deck lolz The only deck I have left is a Shaman deck   You want the honest truth  I dont even enjoy playing it because I have to either beat all the Reno decks turn 6 or lose   Beat Jade Druid before their jades get out of control or lose   Survive face pirate first few turns or lose I aint even mad  because I understand wanting to beat Reno decks  A big fuck you to all you little BabyRage streamers who bitch  moan  and complain about face warrior AND Shamans   Go fuck yourself  seriously  As I said  it must be nice to sit there and BabyRage about these decks while your bills are being paid and then some while you play boring ass 30 minute matches  While Im at it  fuck Blizzard and this Patches  Reno  or Shaman meta  Edit  I forgot Rogue  that is another viable deck  but I dont like playing Rogue either   If I had a decent Pally non control like Murloc  or a decent Hunter deck Id play those  and I do also play some control warrior here and there   Again  not a deck I actually really enjoy \", \"commentId\": \"31419\", \"commentDate\": \"1485290353\"}, {\"comment\": \"Im strongly doubting any
