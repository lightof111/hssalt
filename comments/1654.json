"[{\"comment\": \"Im counting the days before everyone realize the game has gone completely out of control  Discardlock litterally has no downside  Half the time  and Im being generous because its almost 100 of the time  discarding is even an advantage  yet it adds stats to the minions  Primordial Glyph looks balanced until you realize getting another Primordial Glyph from it  a purely RNG thing  is a 100 superior result to any other  because you get spell synergy on top of another spell counting for your quest  And thats only from playing my first few games  I expect it to go much more
