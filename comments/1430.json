another moron whose life sucks and needs to make everyone else feel as miserable and insignificant as they feel  I just concede immediately if playing casual and one of these sad excuse of a person

I close the game and tell Blizzard to go fuck themselves  I have turned into a F2P player prior to this last expansion  They will not have any more of my money for this stupid game ever again  I

spawns a 55 Jade dude   With 5 mana he casts Bane of Doom on the 41 Jade due  summoning Doomguard and killing my 55  I thinkWell  fuck me  that was some rng bullshit  but he has no Reno and I can play Azure Drake  Swipe face and set him at 3  leaving him only two cards to topdeck Reno  Opponents turn draws  taps  Reno FROM THE LEFT  HE HAD IN HAND THE WHOLE TIME  He could have played Reno instead
