"[{\"comment\": \"Trying new decks in casual  went against a face hunter who had me down to 5 health  He twice had lethal and decide to make me run out of cards  The amount of bm in this game is totally unreal  If you think youre that good  then why the hell are you playing in casual for Go to ranked matches Ahem neosomethingrito  Why is there a need to piss off your opponent that badly I feel like another main issue apart from op cards is how players interact with each other  Emotes are sarcastic and put people off  Even if you squelch  they can still put you off by flickering on your cardsheropoweranything  Report system is soo crap  Having to open the battle net client to report someone like why cant we report someone whilst in the Hearthstone client It no wonder why I dont enjoy this game as much anymore  How is it suppose to be fun and interactive when the opponents behaviour is totally wrong I feel like we need to scrap the emote system and just put in a normal chat interface and if you get annoyed  you can autoblock anything the opponent types  In addition  an easy to access report feature  Whilst people playing certain decks are annoying  there really really needs to be a better chat system in place\", \"commentId\": \"26412\", \"commentDate\": \"1475019533\"}, {\"comment\": \"To anyone playing Hunter or Shaman Just shut the fuck and do your OP curved

people are getting REALLY sick with the direction you are taking the game  The only reason I am still playing is because a local tavern has started hosting events and Ive gotten to meet some IRL players  However  when I talk to other players  both IRL and online  there seems to be a consensus that the game is not much fun at all in its current state  You are basically coasting on the easytouse interface and cuteamusing card actions at the moment  I cant even count how many times I have seen rage posts about the 77 flamewreath  which is unstoppable with the right totemic spawn  You have said before that OTK is bad design strategy  but warrior and standard mage cards dont actually reflect that thought process  Plz give warrior and mage MOAR quality spells  How are they supposed to be playable when they only have Execute  Polymorph  Torch  Shield Bash  Brawl  Flamestrike  Ice Block   And I cannot forget to mention Yogg  the RNGbehemoth that completely blanks entire games  I already run protein folding simulations on my computer that I dont get to interact with in any way  I dont need my games turning into card game simulations\", \"commentId\": \"26425\",

whatever I try I get counter  My record so far was 8 losses in a row  but while I was experimenting with some crazy decks  This is T1 Control Shaman deck  not some lets see will it work deck     4 frickin secret Hunters in a row  then Control Warrior or 2 and again hunters etc  I put Eater of Secrets in a deck  never draw one  All my opponents were drawing on the curve exactly what they need  My mulliganed cards are always worst than I got in 1st place  That was yesterday  Today  after reroll shitty quest and I got another shitty 3 Win quest  same deck  3 wins in a row  Not one hunter  but every game I draw Eater  And  before anyone say  NO  I was not on tilt  it started 2 loss 1 win  then suddenly 14 losses  Then I stopped that was the point where I would really start tilting  I am poker player  and I know what tilt is and when I am on tilt  this is something completely different   I guess I have to stop playing after several good matches  because nobody can tell me that 14 losses in a row are just bad luck  RNG or L2P case   It is hard to lose that much even if you play blindly or by rolling the dice what you will play next turn  Or maybe I have to donate some money to Blizzard  because I am F2P player\", \"commentId\": \"26431\", \"commentDate\": \"1475063730\"}]"
