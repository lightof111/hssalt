was really unsure on who to craft as i wanted someone i thought would work with many of my decks  I ended up choosing between Ragnaros and Yoggsaron as I love Rag as a card and a character and Ive known him for a long time  and YoggSaron blew my mind when i saw him in some matches and he would work great in some of my spell focused decks but that still isnt all of them and he was nerfed and so put me even more towards Rag  So I craft Rag and edit him into several of my decks  until I heard about him being removed from standard       I would like to point out that i dont keep much dust and had to make some sacrifices just to be able to craft the Rag and now it was wasted when i could of crafted Yogg or some other helpful Legendary i could actually use for a while \", \"commentId\":
