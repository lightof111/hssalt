paladin in arena  Why Because Me against paladin Gives 22 to 3 minions at the same time  I lose  Me as paladin Gives 22 tp 3 minions  33 to 2 minions  44 to other 2 minions and 66 to 1 minion  I lose because opponent still gets card to deal with it  I play vs paladin and have it almost dead and we are on topdeck war  I topdeck Grimestreet Protector  Hungry Dragon  Truesilver Champion or Tanaris Hogchopper  Proceed to not craft any of those except of Protector and Hungry Dragon when I already lost the board or directly at lethal range  Or the mage who got the perfect MCT steal and then proceeded to topdeck all removals and big ass minions possible  Best part was when mage finally started running out of steam  but got a Ships Cannon Duplicated  played them both and something else to threat my Sunwalker and getting close to lethal  range  I topdeck Hungry Dragon  I play it  Gives my opponent a fucking Swashburglar  that causes the cannons to deal 4 damage to my face  setting me at 3 Health and ending a dreamy deck with a stupid 43\", \"commentId\": \"32422\", \"commentDate\": \"1487346611\"}]"
