mentality Blizzard has is cute  but you end up in situations like this  The last time shaman got nerfed some of the nerfs were suboptimal or incorrect  causing shaman to still be broken as shit  And if you dont nerf frequently you end up having the probability that one class is broken shaman  Tunnel trogg should be nerfed  spirit claws  frothing berserker  smalltime buccaneer and drakonid
