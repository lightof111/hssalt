think the whole thing is fixed  the matchmaking process is a fcking lie They have a system that detects your play time  hours online per day  average time per match  The levels  amount of cards and their rarity  since when you play  etc  Then they match you with classes  decks and players that are better or worse than you  as they wish  The system is corrupted and filled with malicious intent  Sometimes they help me  sometimes they just mess with me for no reason  Maybe there are some other people they want to reward  I am playing for 50 hours straight  and I am going paranoid\",
