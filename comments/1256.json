arent playing control warrior and sometimes even when you are What percentage of your games actually get to turn 10 Like 40 maybe Of the games that get to turn 10 how many of those are Yogg Games Like 80 So either you win or lose in the first 9 turns  or watch as people Yolo Yogg  Thats why the current meta is awful  Sure Secret Paladin was broken but at least when it had 0 cards left and 0 minions on board you were fine  Now we watch as classes spunk their entire hand onto the board top deck Yogg and then hope for the best What bullshit is that\", \"commentId\": \"26353\", \"commentDate\":
