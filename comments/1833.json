{\"comment\": \"This rogue quest is such bullshit  Honestly Blizz nerf it  Everybody says Hur dur the win rate is low  Dont nerf  Heres the thing The win rate is low because of all the idiots playing the deck and all the idiots playing aggro decks  The deck has an alright win rate against aggro but massively stomps anyone who is interested in playing control  So the people with 20 IQ who play it only win control matchups and the people with a functioning brain win everything except a few aggro matchups  The same BS showed up with Jade Druid control got their ass handed to them while everyone said to not worry because aggro was there to put jade in its place  At least with jade you had a chance if you had burn or tried to rush them  There is no chance against quest rogue  Dont tell me freeze mage wins because you can get unlucky draws and they always have bounce minions  Honestly this deck is designed for the lowest of the low  the people who play pirate warrior  This deck  burn mage  midrange hunter and pirate warrior are all so utterly brainless and ludicrous to play against  I see all these comments like well if control becomes strong then we have boring 20 minute games  Well some of us like actually having a challenge in this game and playing a match where the answer to what card do I play isnt always just the card with the same number on it as your mana\",

youre just fed up with them  E g  mage being op in arena and so in constructed lately  I couldnt stand more mages nor quest rogues and all their random cards  Firstly i tried to convince myself that its a part of a game that i want to paly  so i ahve to accept it  But just like in rlf accepting things doesnt always mean you will start to enjoy them  And one very important thing to consider is  whether you play this game for fun which you should be because this is a freaking computer game or youre trying to prove sth playing what you do not enjoy   The only solution for me was switching to casual and conceding to every mage and quest rogue  After 1 month of curation im even able to fight few constructed games and not tilt so much when facing mages and rogues  But i dotn think ill ever come back to ladder grinding  Been too long for me to fool myself that its fun or entertaining   Now all I do is playing my very own decks in casual with very good success  I highly recommend you

the other people  who mention mage as the favourable class  well  duh  of course it will do well against QR  when1 they have ice blocks to buy them another turn 2 they dont rely on minions for their win condition  after all  the rogue cant stop the mage hurling fireballs at their face  dodging taunts ant what not but neither the other classes as well  so i dont like  when ppl use mage as an argumment against QRs\", \"commentId\": \"38448\", \"commentDate\": \"1496681652\"}, {\"comment\": \"Well  Quest Rogue is somewhat tricky to catagorize  Played that deck myself and there are really horrible matchups  such like any Hunter  Mages  Pirate Warriors  Zoo Wild  AggroToken Druid  which are heavily unfavored for the Rogue  On the other hand they basically win against any slower deck immediatly  such like Reno decks or Classic Control  So  this makes this deck very polarized  Its either very bad or dominating  Nothing in between exists and that is simply not good for the game  I like that Rogue finally have another archetype that works other than Miracle  but then again  it comes with a price  In wild for example i love to play Reno Mage sometimes  but i can immediatly concede if i see a Rogue  You cant do anything gameending before turn 1011 and thats simply too long against this deck  Decks that eliminate entire archetypes are problematic and while in standard it will rotate in 1 5 years  we have to deal with that forever in wild  which is concerning On the other hand i dont know how to change it  without either a completely kill it or b change the condition to something new  Blizzard said themself they dont like charge minions that can kill you from hand in an OTK fashion  but thats exactly what this deck does  Dont know where the logic lies in that one
