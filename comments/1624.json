seem to do badly against reno locks  Naturally  last night most of my matchups were reno locks  Those asshats always have the answers they need when they need them  I dont think Ive ever faced one

just watching it  I really didnt like him as a player because he ends up screwing everyone else over with heavy RNG Amnesiascs fight against him last year was shite  Low and behold Pavel proves he

play last tournament was heavy RNG based He got lucky and his luck ran out  Hes in no way a professional player  Honestly the way he talks about himself and the way he plays his games just show that

Jade Lightning to win him his one game he otherwise would have lost  I wish someone would have beat him out during the qualifying match   Yes  Im happy hes been knocked down  Ill be even happier when
