fast  doubly so in casual  The upside is my last 2 matches were a control warrior I was playing yoggmonkey priest and  while I eventually lost the match in fatigue  it led to a very interesting game and an OTK priest which was really amusing to see  So those were fun at least\", \"commentId\": \"26498\", \"commentDate\": \"1475251306\"}, {\"comment\": \"I just mean its a lot worse in wild\",

with shamans please delete the hunter class from this game so much cancer and bullshit and they sit down and just use hero power and win  what a fucking joke they dont even use cards for draw power

unavailable in my country  The Khadgar Skin i could work around by logging on a friends phone  But this is Bullshit  I would have payed the stupid full price of the shop skins for this one  Was about to go to sleep  but now im wide awake and furious about this move by Blizzard  I know its silly to get so mad about this  was just so hyped though\", \"commentId\": \"26507\", \"commentDate\":

luckier and thats it    This idea that you contrl anything is pure and utter bull shit   I am so tired of trying various decks and every one of them is 100 draw dependent and opening hand dependent   You win if you get cards and lose if you dont   Period  Now  Ill just play gimmicky bull shit decks   Why not  Same fucking outcome anyways\", \"commentId\": \"26508\", \"commentDate\":

differently from the Khadgar promotion  Honestly  why are they tying this to these limited promotions So many players would be willing to pay money for this in a normal way through the shop  Let alone not everyone is willing to give up credit card details just for this  Or have one It just leaves a bad taste  Good Job  Blizzard\", \"commentId\": \"26509\", \"commentDate\": \"1475276953\"},

 purely a fatigue deck   Im completely in control   Totally destroying   Board control the entire game  we both have about 6 cards left in deck and hes got a full hand thanks to two cabalists tomes and two babbling books he played late  He plays Barnes  summons Antonidas  and uses the 4 1mana spells he got from his tomes and books to get a hand full of fireballs that I had no immediate answer for    I understand if he had played a lot of minions to bait out my SWP or other small minion removals    but he was top decking most of the match until he got his tomes and books   I did  on the other hand  with buffed threats  keeping minions out of Flamestrike range late  using an 8mana Forbidden  etc   I got him to blow both fireballs  frost bolts  and a pyroblast just by playing threats on an empty board I knew hed have a hard time with    I lost this game purely because of him getting lucky despite me controlling the entire match and slowly chipping away at his health   All the thought and effort I put in was meaningless in the end thanks to absolute luck  Fuck this game\", \"commentId\": \"26511\", \"commentDate\": \"1475280079\"}, {\"comment\": \"After trying reach rank 5 with my own decks  thing I always able to do before  I give up and surrender for the bullshit OP decks to get the golden epic  start play with cancer shaman  it is so pathetic easy play with this OP crap  is so unfair  my opponents most of the time can do anything  I in rank 11 before start  reach rank 5 losing a few games only for others shamans decks  The nerfs come late and in my opinion is not enough  much more shaman cards need a lot of severe nerfs to become close some kind of balance  now I finally get what I want  give away this trash  I dont have fun in any game  and have people complain about warriors  any warrior deck dont come close of this bullshit and is a lot more fun to play with and against\", \"commentId\": \"26512\", \"commentDate\": \"1475280771\"}, {\"comment\":
