perfectly and just crushing me it dont mather what i am drawing  even adding cards against aggro like 2 doomsayers not chainging anything  pls blizzard fix this problems and let us play a thinking game and not oh i have x mana so lets play the x mana card every single turn till 4 and  then oh lets play on turn 4 77 and give him windfury next turn because he has no more removals because he needed to play them turn 13 grrrrrrrr  ok now i feel better  have a nice day\", \"commentId\": \"26112\", \"commentDate\": \"1474302700\"}, {\"comment\": \"Why does blizzard devs need to be so fucking retarded that they dont understand how fucking broken some cards can be I honestly wonder if there is single guy in blizzard who actually plays this fucking game Let alone ever listens what community has to say I know that 95 of community ideas are retarded but if you have some kind of a fucking brain you can fish best solutions for the problem  Im getting so fucking tired of this specific card Call of the Wild  Like how can blizzard think that it is balanced Honestly if that card was 9 or 10mana i wouldnt even care that much  Now i know that Control Warrior isnt very good deck in this meta but i have climbed many times to legend with it  Including secret pally season and last season  But thease fucking hunters that are even so bad at this game are making my blood boil  Its not a fucking nuclear science deck to even play it and you basically win every game even if you lose early game hard if you drop Highmane turn 6  Coin  Call of the Wild or Highmane into Call of the Wild  This later card sequence happened to me in last 5 games against hunter and thats why im so fucking mad  I guess i go play a fucking hello kitty island\", \"commentId\": \"26113\", \"commentDate\":
