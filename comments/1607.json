one card in his hand  I am holding my last card DOOM  All seems pretty good to me  He plays Aya Blackpaw   THATS IT IM OUT OF THIS SHITTY META UNTIL THEY FIX THE BROKENNESS THAT IS CANCER JADE Screw you Blizzard for making such a broken and unplayable mechanic that effectively nullifies any longterm deck from being viable I can see why people are now playing Pirate decks so much  because the Cancer Jade decks are running over everything else So I guess Ill bite the bullet and join them now  I never wanted to have to play Pirate decks  but fast early starts seem to be the ONLY way to come

more is Brode  I genuinely believe whatever rank people achieve playing those so called meta  decks is irrelevant  Slowly climbed up from rank 20 to 17 and every second loser is a golden hero Renolock or Jade Druid or another fucking Jade Shaman  Why the fuck arent they higher I have a fucking excuse running a homebrew Paladin  these boring fucking netdecks in potato ranks are just ruining the game

Mage which worked wonders  played a random Hunter deck for quests and my super old Secret Pally which Im sorry but cant get bored of  However    Since Monday morning I lost ALL my RNG  Fell back to Rank 10 losing all the games I played and then some more  I was so desperate yesterday that I even played a JadeCtrl Shaman and again  desperation Pirate Warrior with the least amount of success you can imagine  Im currently at an approx  400 loss streak with these decks   Naturally because I was pretty tilted last night  I wanted to brawl in hopes of a pack  Played about 10 games  needless to say I lost all of them and I dont even know how this is actually possible  I know Im not a particularly goodlucky player but nothing like this has ever happened to me  On top of it all most people Im now matched up with are either running golden heroes andor legendary card back  I could go to these ranks before in previous months  but never ever have I been this unluckybad at this game  Has the match up script been tweaked  or\", \"commentId\": \"33754\", \"commentDate\": \"1489656836\"}, {\"comment\": \"A tad salty  I mean at least he keeps his salt here  In other threads he keeps calm  no

18ish cards left in my deck and thats the one you pull  leaving me no way to possibly remove it because Id already used my hard removal on your Ysera you played the turn before  then removing your 76 massive dragon you pulled off of it   Pretty upset since I had a perfect curve and everything and they literally won because they stole my Ragnaros out of my deck and hid behind it by removing anything I played with their smaller minions  I then drew my actual Ragnaros too late and even though it removed the one they took from me thanks Rag  youre the best 3 it wasnt enough to stop them from having lethal after taking 3 full turns of Ragnaros damage   So tired of this RNG bull where your opponent can literally win the game without even having to worry about whats in their own deck  At least the burgle mechanic stole cards across the class  Dragonkin Operative is too overpowered  Not only does it show you 3 cards in your opponents deck but you get to take one too  from an already condensed card pool  Theres literally nothing you can do to play around it unless you manage to pull your threats into your hand before they play operative where they end up sitting for a couple turns due to high cost   I wish instead of picking a card from your opponents deck it just selects on randomly instead  or it allows you to see 3 cards in your opponents deck but doesnt allow you to take one similar to a scry ability  Youre already getting a 56 body on the field  I dont expect my wins handed to me and can accept a loss when it happens  but when that loss literally comes from my opponent effectively locking me out of playing the game for turns on end using one of my own cards  it takes all the fun out of at least trying to win  I went from 25 health to lethal with no way of stopping it in a position I was otherwise comfortable at  Its like Priest gets a deck that has 56 extra cards in it since they can combo Dragonkin off Brann and Netherspite as well while Im stuck using what Ive got in mine  They never seem to run out of steam or threats   Just going to note that this happened in Wild and the opponent was using a Standard deck while I was playing a Wild one  Keep your standard bullshit out of wild  I had swapped to Wild for some actual fun instead of grinding in Standard facing the same decks over and over  Was hoping for some variety  Nope  Nothing but Standard decks in Wild and Im lucky if I face one wild deck while playing\", \"commentId\": \"33757\", \"commentDate\": \"1489666896\"}, {\"comment\": \"Alright fair point  I  personally  think card draw RNG isnt the problem  its the fact that SO MANY cards themselves rely on RNG  How did Yogg even get passed Thats just stupid  Or flame juggler  flamewanker All this crap where a coin toss can

a larger number of coin tosses and decisions you make during the game   like the muligan  what cards to play at what point  wheter to vomit your hand out or hedge against aoe  Some RNG is just more flashy than other  such as Rag or Yogg  Humans are in general really bad at judging the effect of their own actions against randomness  attributing bad instances to luck and good to skill\",

luck is bad sometimes  but if Im being honest for a minute  not stupidly crazy and constant   I have good moments too  you just dont hear about it I hit rank 10 last night with Jade Druid  finally   I am fully capable of hitting at least rank 5 every month  its just that some decks I dont find enjoyable whatsoever  so I try to make my own or play something that I find interesting but isnt tier 1 or 2  and eventually decide that grinding isnt worth my time    As to how do I keep calm in other threads  I like to contribute positively  and would generally like to be seen as a competent and
