control deck that is designed for golden monkeyfatigue type of deck P   later i entomb his nefarian and ysera and use them to humiliate the roper without delivering lethalattacking each turn   i also heal him using forbidden healing and let him kill himself exactly using eye for an eye   total game time is around 50 minute  and i was watching  a video while playing the game so his roping plan fail and he had elise in his deck too P i was hoping ysera could give me a dream card so i can play nefarian again and hope to get forbidden healing the second time   and dont tell me he doesnt mean to rope  because when he had no card left or little card and all he could do was hero power   he rope every single time P and when he thought he had an answer to my minion he end the turn early   like for 34 turn in the game\", \"commentId\": \"21216\", \"commentDate\": \"1465162398\"}, {\"comment\": \"40 WOG packs 0 legendaries    Fuck this game\", \"commentId\": \"21217\", \"commentDate\":
