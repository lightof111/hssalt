be fun to play a game where either you or your opponent concedes on turn 4  stuck at rank 2 currently  played a lot in the last 2 days and literally every second game is the same  except for mage ofc because they just rng their way through to the win  additionally everytime you switch  to adapt  you get matched with your worst matchups for the first three games  so you have to climb again and againexceptions are ofc brainless aggro decks but then again we are at my first point at the beginning   its a pitty that players in hs are so retarded and that brainlessly winning with broken decks is far more important that having actual fun in the game or try out sth new  to all you players out their who make this game just not fun anymore fuck you  edit wanted to reply to chiribuchiriba\",

duplicate card in the deck because I have a Holy Nova and a Dragonfire Potion  My first 2 games I draw my Dragonfire Potion before I draw my Shadow visions  so I can only get a Holy Nova from them and I lose because Im getting outvalued by insanely greedy decks  Im first in my third game and I have 2 Shadow Visions in my starting hand  so I keep them both to get a Dragonfire Potion from them and a 2drop  Can you guess which card I first draw on turn 2  after my Mulligan Thats right My fucking only copy of Dragonfire Potion  Nice RNG Blizzard P S  He later played his Thoughtsteal when I had 15 cards left in my deck  and can you guess which card he got from my deck Thats right my fucking Kazakus 2 out of 15  what are the odds Oh  and he later got a Jaraxxus from his Kazakus Potion and a Krul

they finally highroll an aggro deck  doesnt even make me that salty that they won  just makes me wonder how bad the average SEA server legend player is that they not only tech for aggro and lose because of it but think its worth it just to beat aggro that one time  and think that makes them good players  its just sad to see that supposedly legend level players still get so salty about playing against aggro just because I cant afford to buy cards on their lower skilled server\", \"commentId\": \"37958\", \"commentDate\": \"1495643649\"}, {\"comment\": \"I saw someone say that Mage has
