destroyed my opponent  and am already sick of it  Not only did I feel disgusting for winning that game  its also such a blatantly obvious deck  which makes it incredibly boring in my opinion  How can

necessarily a bad thing  but I wonder how this game would be if netdecking wasnt a thing  Druid  warrior  priest  warlock   One thing applies to all these classes I know all their exact 30 cards before theyve even played any  I know its somewhat hypocritical  because I netdeck myself  but atleast I make some tech choices and swaps in my decks  And some decks  like my renolock  I make entirely myself  I just wonder what it would be like if everyone made their own decks\", \"commentId\": \"28933\", \"commentDate\": \"1480927960\"}, {\"comment\": \"Blizzard doesnt get that it doesnt matter

gonna complain about the game  really  not this time Im complaining about PEOPLE this is the moment when everybody can try out some crazy  interesting  new stuff and the people who play this game are only interested in winning games with the stupidest aggro decks around  what the hell is wrong with all of you I mean  is the need to netdeck a disease  is there a cure for itAll you can see is Jade druids  Pirate warriors and Shamans  some Paladins too  throwing out their entire hand costantly  Is the game funny for you allThen dont complain about metadecks  curvestone and other bullshit because

he topdecks  Fine  i can recover  Nourish for mana into Soggoth the Slitherer he counters with Doomsayer which i can clear while developing Dark Arakkoa  Game should be all but over at that point  but blizzard decided otherwise  one Inkmaster Solia into Flamestrike  followed up by a Felfire Potion from Kabal Chemist later my close to unbreakable board is cleared  but i can win with one of the 5 damage cards in my deck if i draw them off my second Nourish  Ofc i get silch  I can put him to 1 and have a YShaarj  Rage Unbound for next turn if he taunts and Alexstrasza in case he heals  Topdeck reno  ofc i proceed to play my old god and innervate out a Loot Hoarder  get Baron Geddon  so i am in pretty good shape  Firelands Portal into a taunt which blocks my geddonm i can set him to 13 however  board is clear  his rag snipes my alex after he frostbolted my geddon  while i am stuck with 2 copies of Mistress of Mixtures in my hand  One kazakus potion later and not even Deathwing can save me  i lost  First of all probs to him to see the line of play that potentially kept him alive in all those hopeless situations  however seeing how this game happened after 4 losses to either priest or jaderogue who happened to have the perfect answer 23 times per game each and me needing one win to get to 150 gold to start an arena  i am contemplating deinstalling  TlDr this company will never get a single cent from me\", \"commentId\": \"28948\", \"commentDate\": \"1480958145\"}]"
