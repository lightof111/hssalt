combo  It costs roughly 14k dust  so a bunch of legendaries  epics  Since I dont play wild a lot  I always been trapped in the rank 23 section  Or in other words the matchmaking gives me opponents with decks having Lord of the Arena  Raid Leader and other entry level stuff   I said it once  and I say it again it is such a bad experience for both  opponents if experienced players can fall back

experienced in any game Ive ever played  Of course I had a bunch of fanboys  with their holier than thou attitudes  get their panties in a bunch over it  but that is my experience  I know Im not alone  Its like people feel like they have to attack anyone who doesnt share their same point of view  I really dont know whats up with hearthstone players  Everyone is so toxic  rude   just overall shitty  it baffles me  BMing every fucking game  gloating  roping when they have lethal  all that kinda shit  Its almost as if most of their lives literally revolve around this game  probably have nothing else going on in life  The only joy they get in life is when they win a match  Sad Cant add anyone as a friend win or lose  because they automatically assume youre gonna flame them  I tried to add almost everyone I played today  literally only had one accept  I was just trying to give someone a free 80g quest  That right there  is a direct reflection of the behavior people are used to with this

playing mid range and control decks and most would say they think the meta would be a lot better with them  However  they created a deck that punishes all control decks  winning on turn 5 or 6 with zero interaction  Their response is if you want to win  just play aggro  They said it doesnt have a great win rate so it is fine  purely because of the aggro match ups  How is this ok with them Just remove prep and it will be much better\", \"commentId\": \"38668\", \"commentDate\": \"1497315562\"}, {\"comment\": \"Try to play a couple games of Wild with fun decks  just run into that 18 sample

in standard its way harder to climb right now as the decks from the new rotation are found mostly aggro again  who wonders you stupid aggrocunts and every low shit can afford at least one of those
