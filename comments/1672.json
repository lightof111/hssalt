become  The quests are coinflip win  Some quests are not even playable  poor design and moronic dev team  The rng factor with adapt is to such an absurd level the game has reached toddler level  The game as an esport was never much now its totally a joke  The only thing the game has is good artwork and funny card emotes  The game is nothing but a toilet time waster  This xpan finally killed it for pretty much everyone except the fanboys and youtube beggers  The game was poorly designed from the get go and they refuse to fix the issues  They never will  The 65 IQ crowd they cater to loves it so they dont care  I for one dont watch tournaments  I dont support youtube beggers aka  pro players and Im done with blizzard as a customer  There are many other things better to spend time on  This is the end for me  Aside from doing the quests I will pile the gold and sell off right before next xpan hits for maximum value and be done  Shadowverse is a much better game in every respect  Maybe when they fire the morons they employ now and actually put effort into a product     wait     wont happen   its blizzard aka craptavision\", \"commentId\": \"35093\", \"commentDate\": \"1491872139\"},

share of fun with it  But last night i relized how much I hate playing aginst aggro  I did relize before ungoro that pirate warrior would still be super strong and awfull  but atleast i thought it would be kept in check a little bit by all the amazing taunt   And it sort of is when you draw it   and thats the problem  I just feel like my games are coin flipps  And i dont even play to win primarily  i want to make decks and have fun  And right now fun is not achived  So Im out Thankfully faeria is comming to mobile shortly so I wont be starved for to long  And faeria is Amazing And so is Elderscrolls ledgends Boath have exelent systems to keep aggro in check  And even duelyst and shsdowverse are allright  There are so many other games   I love you Hearthstone  i have since classic
