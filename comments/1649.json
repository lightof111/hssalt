theyd unplug mouse from PC and click while watching movie    isnt that more interesting than watching at empty screen I genuinely cannot understand  I win a lot vs those inferior worms so I dont mind when it comes to that  they often make me climb  But I am insulted to be matched with such inferior form of life at all  How can someone like that be on the same rank as me Its not fair  people that just click face like robots should not be able to rank up so high    Cant help being salty even tho I win a lot vs them last season 67 7 wr with Reno Priest  season before 73 259 with same deck and even made AntiFace War with 360 vs them  so its not that losers salt Still  its insulting and boring to play against such beings that are allowed to rank up without any form of brain  If this isnt fixed with UnGoro I will be forced to quit my favorite game  not fun neither winning nor losing playing against badly designed AI\", \"commentId\": \"34621\", \"commentDate\": \"1491318586\"},

vomit better cards from their hand on curve will be the victor  Its really more like two blindfolded boxers going at it  Just swinging wildly and hoping something lands   Like  you can play your unique decks  and something outside of the meta  but youre only handicapping yourself  Just vomit cards on curve and hope it works  If not  try again  Ive honestly been wasting time playing anything

basically curve stone except in druids case they manipulate the curve to all hell by ramping  Shaman  How is it that I have fought 23 shamans in 3 days and out of that 19 of them had tunnel trogg and totem golem openings   seriously i charted them after facing 3 in a row   I dont care about mulligan and all that rubbish because statistically the odds of having your only 1 drop minion and your only good 2 drop minion in your opening hand is not mathematically probable in a deck that runs bad 4 drops  2 drop overload weapons a lot of reactive spells and very very little draw and yet they still ALWAYS have their perfect curve   Druid  need to have wild growth cycled out because its basically gotten to the point now that  wild growth into jade ramp into nourish mean while your turn 2 and 3 minion gets owned by swipe the following turn and then they drop 63  22 on your turn 4 minion is all druid know how to do   why dont they ever draw all their late game like i do with my better mana
