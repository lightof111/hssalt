thread is to let out the rage  It clearly works well for SB  so be happy that hes letting out his rage in a friendly manner  I dont care if someone would take up pages of this thread  if that works for that person that works   And personally I do think rank 5 is a bit of an accomplishment  There are plenty of players with good decks who cant reach it  It doesnt show that much sure  but it does show that you have an understanding of what youre doing unless you do it with pirate warrior or something  but SB seems like a guy that plays a variety of decks  Also note Youre bordering a personal attack here  Take it from a guy whos been banned several times  watch what you say\", \"commentId\": \"37292\", \"commentDate\": \"1494748638\"}, {\"comment\": \"The complaint is clearly expressed
