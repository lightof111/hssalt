talk Shit  this has happened to me before with another Huntard who i had to report to blizzard bc he did the same thing  so let me be clear to all the Huntards out there  your stupid aggro deck that you copied from online isnt really playing Hearthstone  a real hearthstone player makes his own deck and experiments with the different synergies and plays the game for enjoyment  not to see how fast they can win ok i feel better \", \"commentId\": \"21478\", \"commentDate\": \"1465655213\"}, {\"comment\": \"Anyone who plays HS is a hearthstone player  No such thing as real or fake hearthstone
