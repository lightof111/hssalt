dont disagree with you that a lot of people netdeck  I get that loads of people play the exact same deck and its annoying  But I completely disagree with you that nobody plays anything not net decked  That is a very biased generalization   This isnt the perfect example  but I for one dont netdeck  Right now  I play KleptoYogg Rogue Burgle with Yogg but not once did I go online and look for a competitive decklist for this deck  My deck has 14 minions including Cutpurse  and the spells I run are mostly just delay spells and Thistle Tea  In fact  my late game is literally just Thaurissan  Arcane Giant because if youre playing Yogg  a giant is always nice and Yogg  THATS IT  When I made a Midrange Hunter  all I did was type What is Midrange Hunter and find the first article which just described how the deck is supposed to be played  The deck recommended cards like Infested Wolf and Call of the Wild  but I only played Infested Wolf didnt have CotW and then filled the rest in on my own  Every deck I make I make by my own decisions  If I fuck it up in game  I improve it  I dont see a point in netdeckingI just play for fun  why the need to netdeck  Another thing maybe youre salty about double Brawl  Maybe you think every Warrior netdecks because they just happen to run two Brawls  You would like it  right  When your opponent burns his Brawl and doesnt have anything else  Let me tell you why  as a Warrior  it has become necessary to run Double Brawl  The current meta is full to the brim with Aggro decks  If you think the Patron era was bad  it is nothing compared to the meta now  Warriors lack concrete and viable AoE Come on  Whirlwind is pathetic in terms of damage output  and most of the other removal cards are single target removal  Brawl is the closest thing Warriors have to board clear  but in the current meta of Aggro  just Brawling once isnt enough  most classes can just as easily return the board state  Double Brawl is a necessity for Warriors because its the only true viable board clear not involving single targeting   Or how about this  I have played Casual a lot and I have seen some creative decksat least to me  A few weeks ago  I ran into a Spell Damage Druid that ran Jungle Moonkin and Evolved Kobold  EVOLVED KOBOLD Who even runs that I ran into CThun Shaman I mean  have you HEARD of CThun Shaman  I ran into ShadowLurker Rogue Moat Lurker with Youthful Brewmaster and Shadowstep  Silence Priest  Control Hunter kinda    He just played really control    Maybe youve just been unlucky  but Ive seen a few creative decks  Those that Ive added as friends all say the same thing they just made the deck  been losing  and just happy to finally win against someone  And Im not mad about it   Heres a tip play Casual on Wild  Who gives a damn about Ranked\", \"commentId\": \"24605\", \"commentDate\": \"1471947251\"}, {\"comment\": \"Beast druid incoming  save some rants for it\", \"commentId\": \"24606\", \"commentDate\": \"1471947314\"}, {\"comment\": \"As a Burgle Rogue player  I feel a little justified to defend the deck  Yes  its very Priest like in terms of our kleptomaniac tendencies  But unlike Priests  we just take the cards your class plays  That may not sound very good but consider this If a Priest used Thoughtsteal  and you ran a Control deck with tons of Legendaries  then you were in for it because it takes the legends from your deck  The chances of Thoughtsteal giving Priests a good card is pretty damn high  With Burgle  we just take the cards from the class  Sure  it may mean we can get Tirion from Swashburglar but its equally likely we get some useless card like Divine Strength or Quartermaster I mean  its useless if you have no means of summoning Recruits  The chances of you getting a bad card from Burgle is so much higher  especially now because of Purify\", \"commentId\": \"24607\", \"commentDate\": \"1471947859\"}, {\"comment\": \"when a priest class defeats you by stealing cards\",
