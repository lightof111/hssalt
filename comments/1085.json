 i went all in with my patrons  he runs Shade into a patron    then plays brawl   took brawl out of the deck  since it wasnt helping anyway  queued again into the new flavor of the month netdeck murloc nzoth paladin  i forced out all of his healing with frothings  had been holding all of my combo pieces for a OTK worgen and patron flood in hand  the only problem was my last 6 cards were 2
