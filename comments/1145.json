used to enjoy playing some Shaman but after Tunnel Trogg came out it ruined the class for me  Its funny that you mention those 4 classes  because those are literally the exact 4 that I REFUSE to play  theyre just boring to me  Anyway   for a deck you can use on ladder  Id try any type of Rogue deck  A lot of people bitch about how bad it is  but when played correctly its actually quite good  NZoth is probably the best on ladder right now  If it doesnt seem to work out  theres always tempo Mage although most lists right now are pretty aggressive  I play a more midrange version that you might like  What cards are you missing for token Druid If you have the cards for it  you could play ramp Druid  Its usually got enough taunts to shut down aggro and the list I run has performed well against midrange and control as well its super flexible  you can swap out pretty much any of the late game legendaries for other ones that you think will perform better  I personally REALLY like Deathwing in this deck and Rafaam has been better than Ysera  Ill post lists for these decks  but my last suggestion is NZoth Paladin  Most lists are pretty similar so you can just search it up  even though Paladin is considered a weaker class right now  its still got plenty of tools against a lot of the meta decks  Hope one of these works out for you  and good luck on ladder dont get discouraged too early  you still have plenty of time left this season      edit Druid deck is a little cutoff  obviously the card that you cant see is Innervate\", \"commentId\": \"23949\", \"commentDate\":
