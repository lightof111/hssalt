can not understand why Blizzard is so much supporting the aggro players  Just think about how fucked you are Standart players going to be after Reno Brann Thaurissan Justicar and so on cards rotates out  That cancer has even came to Wild and now I am even happy to fight against Secret Paladins because these poor guys are now Tier 23  60 of matchups of rank 5 4 3 are aggro  and it is even more braindead than Zoolock or Face Hunter who actually require minimal 1 skill  But when I see that aggro piratte fetishist and on first I hear   Im in charge now I already wanna kill my opponent  Sure agrro should exist but it should kill yout opponent on turn 6 and not a fucking turn 3 with coin or turn 4\", \"commentId\": \"30219\", \"commentDate\": \"1483031585\"}, {\"comment\": \"I am so beyond frustrated with arena  Been over three months trying to get better  My best run is 2 wins  Every time I have a lead  more cards then my opponent  a sure fire victory  They just top deck draw  answer after answer  after answer  after answer  On perfect curve  best card for every situation  Last game that brought upon this frustration  I have 7 cards in hand  opponent has one  Im up 27 to 16  In three fucking turns  they manage to put 27 damage on the board  I get nothing but 1 drops that HEAL MY OPPONENT Might as well shove a cracked rusty sword up my ass  Why dont I ever get this amount of luck Ill draw fucking zombie chow turn 12  or something I needed 7 turns ago  I would love to play arena more  but the luck of the draw is just never  ever in my favor  Im just feeding wins and wasting gold  This is so infuriating  Like  I never  ever  everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr get a good draw  Over 150 games  and it just never happens  Its as if god himself is drawing cards for my opponent  and shitting all over mine   Never again  Ill just play casual and ladder  I really wanted to try at least 5 wins before I give up  but if i could only record these matches  Its pure insanity  How are you 02 and just being able to get ANSWER AFTER ANSWER  draw after draw  HOW\", \"commentId\": \"30220\", \"commentDate\": \"1483033105\"}, {\"comment\": \"so there I was playing some pirate warriornot

Shadowform NZoth Priest Me  Not a play by play of the game  just a  summary of all the ways I got bent over My Shifting Shade gave me Beneath the Grounds  I play it at some point relatively early in the game and the Rogue gets down to 8 cards in deck before winning  I never saw one of them  Rogues turn 4 he topdecks AND plays Beneath the Grounds which locks out my planned turn 5 Raza the Chained  I showed no previous sign of being a Reno deck  so just the luck of it    My turn 5 Oh look  Nerubian number 1 from the Rogues previous play Rogue uses Swashburglar twice  Ill revisit this shortly    Nerubian number 2 pops and the Rogue gets even more help Whatever  I can use my oneoff minions  Im not in Shadowform at this point and I only have Raza so I play him for the free hero power and heal myself up while keeping the Rogues board as minimal as possible while dealing damage to the Rogue  I chip away with some AOE and at his health  I have him at 2 health   if only I can draw Shadowform    Rogue topdecks the second Beneath the Grounds and plays it  two more of them immediately pop the following turn  Reno cannot be used as 2 Nerubians remain in my deck  I dont have shadowform and I dont have a board  I AOE again to limit as much incoming damage as possible  Rogue burgles Flash Heal x 2 WTF  After the Rogue double Flash heals  guess what I top deck Shadowform  Lethal gone Whatever   I once again get him down low and next turn I have lethal  Remember the Swashburglar Yeah  I do to   Priest of the Feast  Greater Healing Potion  Coin  FML Rogue healed well out of range of any damage I could do  the two remaining Nerubians decided to help him out and some Jade Golems also rammed my face  Not a fun game\", \"commentId\": \"30222\", \"commentDate\": \"1483035281\"},
