miracle rogue is not for me  Built a tempo rogue deck with some pirates in it  Currently 210 in casual  with it  playing versus tier one decks like zoo  aggro shamans and dragon warriors almost all the time  FUN\", \"commentId\": \"23511\", \"commentDate\": \"1470128339\"}, {\"comment\": \"You know   with all the aggro hate for Zoo and Mid range and even Control  its kinda strange that people have left out the one deck that really is the pure cancer     FUCKING   CUNTTHUN  Seriously  whoever thought of making CThun and his minions the way they are deserves to die in a fire  The standard play for any CThun deck 2 mana Beckoner  3 mana Twilight Elder  4 mana Cthun Chosen or Disciple    You get the point  The thing is   just looking at these minions  this deck is already OP beyond anything  Either you face an over value minion like a 23 on Turn 2 that has no drawback or you face a minion with Taunt that STILL buffs CThun  All the while  youre trying to survive the stupid Aggro while ramming your minions into your opponents minions   knowing full well youre on a timer because if that cancer player gets to turn 10  he gonna topdeck that shit and wreck the ever living shit out of you   CThun decks are the living definition of brainless  Much like his followers  who are for some reason dumb and brainless to follow a many eyed hentai nightmare as a God  the people who play CThun decks literally just play the same shit every time  Look  we all played the deck when WoG came out dont deny it  Its fine  we were mostly just experimenting  Unfortunately  what we got was a boring ass meta where if your opponent got CThun first  it was pretty much GG for you no matter the board state  CThun decks literally dominate the standard meta and was the reason I quit Standard for Wild  At least in Wild  you didnt always run into a 2 mana 23 on turn 2   I also feel like I should use this to address an important point  Overall  I get it people hate playing against Warrior  But Control decks or overly aggressive cancer decks are the only things standing between CThun dominating the meta entirely  You may not like it  but its a necessity  Just like Handlock was made to counter Zoo  so Control decks were meant to resist CThun\", \"commentId\": \"23512\", \"commentDate\": \"1470131405\"}, {\"comment\": \"Try raptor rogue thats a fun deck\", \"commentId\": \"23513\",

why they NEVER will pick up The stats are all wrong I mean  the only way it would be good if ever  is if all discard cards had stats like Doomguard  sure taken in consideration the costs  but why the hell would anyone play sucubus  lose a card  only for it to be killed by nameyourremovalhere  Same for Librarian or any other discard card ever  If Sucubus was 34 she could see play even outside of discard decks  How come there is a common 4 cost 77 while a rare 5 cost discards 2 cards for less of that statline I mean  Doomguard is perfect  dont get me wrong  but other discard cards could follow more in the line of overloading cards in manner of statlines  You want STICKING minions if you are discarding cards which Doomguard is  a pretty insane sticky minion\", \"commentId\": \"23521\",

for me  I cant play the decks I like cause I just get murdered  Handlock especially  As of now  everything just boils down to aggro aggro aggro  We have every type of Hunter  Zoo  Shaman  Multiple types of Warrior  Tempo Mage  but more realistically its face mage  Then there was decks like OTK Warrior and Yogg which limit nearly all interactivity from the game and leave you feeling despondent about your most recent loss where you played well but still got bet  Im not trying to be a negative nelly or cry or anything but a lot of people would agree that this meta or particular moment in Hearthstone is not fun  Even the new expansion was a let down for me so far  Just a few more control cards is all that was needed  and may still come  which I am hoping for  But for a few weeks I will leave Hearthstone and recharge the batteries  maybe come back for a brawl here or there  But avoid ladder for a good period of time\", \"commentId\": \"23524\", \"commentDate\": \"1470143849\"},
