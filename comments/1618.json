"[{\"comment\": \"Cant believe how many people are playing Jade Druid  Renolock  Dragon Priest  Reno Mage  Jade Shaman  and Pirate Warrior  Ranks 2014 thats 90 of what I have seen  Add in miracle Rogue and its 95  They cant all be completing quests  How much of a shit player do you have to be to not be at rank 5 or better at this stage of the season playing a tuned meta deck The salt is real because I think I dont play badly most games but those decks just have too much of an advantage  Absolutely loathing this meta  still  I have zero confidence that the new expansion wont bring a handful of completely broken synergies that will need nerfing from day one but Blizzard will let them run for weeks or months while all the pirate warrior and Jade Shaman and Renolock players flock to the new meta decks   At least Ive learned the most important Hearthstone rule  never give Blizzard any money for this broken shite\", \"commentId\": \"33968\", \"commentDate\": \"1490173135\"},

dont matter with extremely overpowered decks   What I love is that when you friend them afterwards and break their balls about the deck being stupid overpowered they reply with just doing my dailies  Yeah  right  90 of the fucking ladder just happens to be doing dailies with cancer decks at rank 10 and under Uh huh  Right  Its like just admit it  youre a hopeless asshole that should die  Zero skills    I actually use a resurrect priest that of course isnt that consistent but it screws up my opponents big time  It actually does OK against aggro if I can get priest of the feast resurrected in time for some massive healing  Then  blade masters coming back with 7 health can clear anything they play   I even run prophet Velen in the deck with some burst spells that they also dont see coming  But  like any home brewed deck  it cant keep up with the never ending overpowered bull shit  God I hope this expansion helps this game\", \"commentId\": \"33972\", \"commentDate\":

much in this thread  but it really helps after dropping a rank because someone left their braincells somewhere else  P S  Fuck all of you jade druids three times in a row  in my opinion youre just as braindead as the aggro decks\", \"commentId\": \"33975\", \"commentDate\": \"1490186461\"}, {\"comment\": \"Ok 1 more final post here today because that last jade druid was a sad piece of trash
