So I made a dumb play to tell him  you can take this  The second I decided to let him win he starts spamming Thank you thinking I misplayed  I barely managed to still win the next turn even though I threw away my win condition as a joke  but as you can understand thats the last time I did something nice for someone in Hearthstone\", \"commentId\": \"33080\", \"commentDate\": \"1488625253\"},

nostalgic because this twat Reno is being rotated out So many Reno  Brann  Kazakus decks today In fucking sick of it  The games are boring as hell  they rope out every turn andtake the ultimate piss when making the stupid potions  The decks are more unoriginal and boring than pirate warrior  which I would add I dont even care to lose against because its either over by turn 6 or youve won  I cannot wait until this prick Reno and this prick Brann cycle out  Long  boring games will be a thing of the past  Dont even talk to me about tactics because a child could play Reno all you do is play on curve and drop the magic card when youre low or your opponent is nearing lethal  50 against aggro would be quicker ladder climbing than win streaks vs these dickheads  tldr FUCK YOU RENO PLAYING

last times that my opponent has played Barnes they got Ragnaros the Firelord  I estimate the average amount of minions of my opponent to be at least and Im being very generous 10  Probability 0 001 My last 3 opponents that played Murloc Knight got another Murloc Knight  Probability 0 01 The last 2  times I played Murloc Knight I got Murloc Tinyfin  Probability 0 3 I so wish I were making this up  but I guess this is payback for packing 8 legendaries in 15 packs  I have all the pack luck but 0 of the ingame RNG  Also Id like Blizzard to change the fact that you can see how much gold youve gotten before opening your Arena rewards  It should hide your gold at the bottom right untill after youve opened them\", \"commentId\": \"33083\", \"commentDate\": \"1488628415\"}, {\"comment\": \"I really got mad yesterday in Arena  facing an opponent with a Wild deck  He went first with turn 1 Zombie Chow  then proceded to buff his weapon twice with Tinkers Sharpsword Oil   yeah  thanks a lot

 paper  scissors you literally cant win no matter how well you play  Or  matches are decided on luck of draw  Chillwind Yeti used to be a good card  A win was decided on how well you played  not on overpowered shit   Solution play Gwent Less RNG  You start with 10 cards in your hand from a 25 card deck  You get to play the deck you designed with consistent results  Trust me guys  this game is so much better  Hearthstone just makes me angry   Youre a better player than you think  Hearthstone in its current state just makes you feel stupid because you can lose no matter what  Fuck

main problem  how do they all draw them so consistently One guy had 2 smugglers run and 2 grimstreet played as his first 4 cards Did he exactly draw them all or did he have 20 of them in the deck How
