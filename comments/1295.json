face the unfavorable matchups  but its near imbossible not to rank up with midrange as long as you are an average player  of course its not 100 brainless like the aggrosmorc version  but its also not difficult to win with  midrange shaman perfomes too well right now  there are counters to it but those suffer if facing other decks\", \"commentId\": \"27174\", \"commentDate\": \"1476976126\"},

classes only exception is  you guessed it right  the disgusting Shaman  Sure  not all of them are tier 1 level  but none of them include Yogg and  this might shock you  I tech in cards that are not featured in the meta snapshot of the best decks O You talk about me prefering RNG You play shaman  which is now literally based on rolling the best totem 25 of the time Or rolling high with the most effective AoE combined with hero power Or getting a random 1 drop from Maelstorm Or hitting the right target with Ragnaros My favourite deck is Malygos Rogue  one of the only ones which contain almost zero RNG besides card draw Shamans are overpowered  easy to pilot with basic logic and math skills  completely rely on luck and 35 of the people abused it among the competitive ladder scene earlyseason  If this meta is better than ever for you then you have serious mental issues Might wanna be cautious with your assumptions next time or you will end up getting roasted in your own pit of
