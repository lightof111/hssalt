They never roll that 11 totem which if course is the most useless one  Never   I dont care what the statisticians here say about probability and the law of averages   Fock them   Shaman always gets what it needs  when it needs it  On top of that  they have overpowered cards at every single mana level   Flame tongue totem turns their board into a bunch of wrecking balls  Spell damage buffs weapons AND removals become full board clears   Feral spirit is a brutal card that locks the board down for them  They have great damage spells  And  the overload penalty is a joke and doesnt slow them down at all  Its like getting a weekend in jail for murder  The extreme power of the overload cards doesnt match the alleged penatly  Ya ever notice that after they play an overload card that the next turn is still fucking some awesome card Yeah  And late game  overload hardly matters  fucking class is out of control  Here is the deal though   if you use shaman and arent winning like every game then you arent doing it right  The class cant lose unless you suck at the game\", \"commentId\": \"32845\", \"commentDate\": \"1488110923\"}, {\"comment\": \"Now this is complete bullshit  Me

range deck  like me  loses instantly to the cancer meta decks  And as you said  its not even fun  I can and do lose games but can still enjoy it IF its truly well played and interesting  But now Nah  you just watch your face get smashed by a full board of dick head pirates by turn 3 or all your hard work is undone by fuckface Reno Jackson  Every  Fucking  Game  Is  The  Same\", \"commentId\":
