last a game without smashing my screen  Just delete shaman from the game already Blizzard  You made a huge mistake and now the braindead lowlifes are taking advantage of it  Shaman is still absurdly broken after the nerfs  and I dont expect Blizzard to nerf them again soon because that would sort of be admitting they were wrong with their judgement of shamans the first time\", \"commentId\":

only having a 10 win rate in ranked  and 4 in arena I decided to give it a go      I was moronic and stupid enough to buy all the cards  and spend time trying to get better by watching the videos

is zero possibility of improvement\", \"commentId\": \"27979\", \"commentDate\": \"1479338104\"}, {\"comment\": \"Lets make a 0 mana 55 Taunt      Only fucking Blizzard is that goddamn fucking

multiplayer game on PC  the team that wins are ALWAYS the people who type gg first      now you may this is this is harmless sportmanship  but its not you know why cause they dont say it when they lose  I remember playing Magic the gathering and my opponent had me beat and he was so cocky that before i conceded  he put out his hand to shake it  saying GG  thats what its basically like  because the ironic thing is like i mentioned  if they lose  no word  but if they win  you will hear it the second the game ends\", \"commentId\": \"27988\", \"commentDate\": \"1479359695\"}, {\"comment\":

across the table  I think it was one of my better gaming moments when I came back and beat him anyway  I dont mind admitting when Im outplayed  but honestly in Hearthstone there are rarely matches where it seems like its going to go either way and then the outcome is determined by someone playing better than the other person  Its usually a lucky topdeck or some unlikely RNG that decides most matches and that gets a bit old after awhile  In fact  it usually ruins a match thats been pretty interesting up to that point\", \"commentId\": \"27992\", \"commentDate\": \"1479361679\"}]"
