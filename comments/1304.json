their ideals how meta decks arent fun and how they are unable to enjoy the game cos their shitty  stupid  badly made decks that they consider as original  unique and fun dont work  You are not original  you just made a crap instead of a deck  no wonder it doesnt work  its not Blizzards fault and its not fault of people that enjoy decks that actually are made to be good  cos you suck at deckbuilding and have twisted idea of having fun\", \"commentId\": \"27352\", \"commentDate\": \"1477512534\"}, {\"comment\": \"Yesterday    down to the last few cards  Im at 20  mage at 8   I

can choose from  something for everyone to enjoy But if there is only one dish you can choose from it suddenly gets alot more stale and boring  Always the same food  after some time you will get sick of it  Just like when the Hearthstone meta is diverse  there are alot of different decks you can play  there is something for everything to enjoy But when there is only 1 deck being played  it gets alot more boring  Right now its play MidRange Shaman or get punished  As I said  its like instead of having a rich buffet you switch it out with only 1 dish It gets boring really quickly  Do you understand Probaly not  you have most likely not even played in rank 3 and above since it seems you havent seen what the current meta is like\", \"commentId\": \"27354\", \"commentDate\":
