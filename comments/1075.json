"[{\"comment\": \"I only play it for turneys and to get golden portrait You obviously know yourself that the class is completely insane right now  Not that you need to explain yourself for playing what you want to play  because its a game and all  but just understand where people are coming from when they get annoyed by shamans and dont take it personally  I get slightly triggered myself when someone mentions midranged shaman  Theres nothing midranged about a deck that includes the best early game cards in the entire game  a deck thats running  0 cost 55s with taunts  4 cost 77s  2 cost 34s and a 3 cost 32 summon a free 34 yeah rigged by illuminati and Tunneltroggs and Facehammer and a myriad of other facemodeenabling cards  Lets be honest  running hex and Aoebuffs and lightningstorming nearly empty boards to get by taunts doesnt make it any less of a face deck\", \"commentId\": \"22431\", \"commentDate\": \"1467775385\"}, {\"comment\": \"I honestly think if I could give my dust to somebody else in game  I would right now   Im so sick of facing nothing but aggro decks in the current ladder   Zoo lock  totem shaman  face shaman  face hunter   thats all i face

playing like a zoo player does retarded  Taps last  mispositions minions  thus wasting damage next turn  etc  Just the typical  rightNow in a game where skill even slightly matters  these should be enough for you to lose the game  But what happens here He gets the perfect curve while I draw nothing  he wins the 1 in 7  and yet he ends up with a 11 on his board and 3hp  1 card in hand  He draws peddler  gets a PO  taps into Leeroy  and bam  14 damage flying in my face for exact lethal and I die  Agro is not the problem  The shitty game which constantly rewards the retarded and lucky noobs is the problem  They always have the burst  they always have the reno on turn 6  yogg always wins them the game on turn 10  double call of the wild always on curve  and the list just keeps on going  It absolutely doesnt matter how shit they play  they get the perfect curve and luck  and win  I hate this game\", \"commentId\": \"22437\", \"commentDate\": \"1467805615\"}, {\"comment\": \"calm down

this pain  i got a win as warlock quest today  so i fired up to the ol zoo deck  first 4 games went almost identical  i drew only one card that i could play before turn 5 each game  my hand consisted of 2x Power Overwhelming  2x Defender of Argus  with the few other high mana cards in deck  In 4 games combined I was able to play 2 crazed alchemists  a councilman  and a flame imp    Finally got a decent opening hand against a priest  he coined excavate evil on turn 4  I played a couple more minions  holy nova on turn 5  I played  gang boss and and councilman  he plays aucheni and circle of healing  i play another gangboss and a small minion  he soulfires it and plays void walker  played more small minions  he holy novas  surely hes out of aoe by now in his hand  play knife juggler and forbidden ritual     top decks excavate evil    after that game I won the next 4 in a row  but im still a bit salty about that RNG lol\", \"commentId\": \"22441\", \"commentDate\": \"1467816086\"},

cleared my board clearing his Carne   So far so good  He then dropped his sylvanas   I entombed Then Chillmaw   I just dropped some minions to contest  Then Tiron   I entombed and used my minions to clear Chillmaw   So far according to plan  Then Ysera   Oh shiz   I cant do anything about Ysera   I start dropping minions like crazy hoping to remove   But  they keep getting sent back to my hand   Sylvanas mostly a couple turns later I finaly clear Ysera only to have NZoth drop for a full board   I drop his Tirion  but  its too little too late  Im toast  Man   I felt like I did everything right
