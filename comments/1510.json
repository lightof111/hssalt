I FACED A MILL ROGUE At my level  where ranks are 1 digit with 5 stars counters Of course it cant be true Who would be so stupid to do that in a meta where aggro is king And theres the Jade Druids too  not many  but some Who can be that suicidal And most unbelievable of all I won  Someone being stupid enough to play a suicide deck I still can believe  But me winning while the rigged mode is on This

faced aggro 5 times in a row Played control shaman  lost WAY too many games against priest duh and 5 arcane giants on a board rogue  then theres jade druids too in the ladder full of aggros how is that even possible Yes  I finally faced pirate warrior at last but then he topdecked two Frothing Berserker which only happens whenever I played control shaman and this is the first time i lost against aggro  he has a perfect hands and I have worst of all 3 giant minions  And my friends are right  this game is  becoming boring as af  I really wanted to go back to GvG expansion rather than this expansionAfter many weeks of Gadgetzan expansion  I finally complained about pirates  I think everyone is right and blizzard should do something right now  there is a reason for it  its way more

they cant ever make more taunt deathrattles  Or good deathrattles  No control deck in Wild that isnt a combo deck can ever be anything but a N Zoth deck  Why wouldnt you just play that Its by far better than any other card in the game  Like 10 times better  for free  with no board or planning  Just like Reno  just draw it and win instantly For all his musings on design  Ben Brode seems pretty short sighted  Summon all deathrattle minions that died this game This is something you figured to do and didnt think it would cause problems Really At no point in your brain did a little light go off to tell you that maybe a one card instant huge board that doesnt die is a dumb ideaOr was the point of designing the Old Gods cards really just to make SURE the game would end on turn 10 and no later Lol  MAN WEVE HAD IT WITH THESE LONG 6 MINUTES GAMES  WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO END THEM Already had to nerf Yogg and eventually theyll have to nerf NZoth  if wild ever slows to the point where you dont just always die on turn 5 yay\", \"commentId\": \"31717\", \"commentDate\": \"1485836577\"}, {\"comment\": \"Morph spells like Devolve  Hex and Polymorph are the best way to deal with NZoth decks
