just because I dont have certain cards  So for new ppl playing in casual mode    no chance because its dominated by ppl with every single card in the game    experimenting with new cards I understand

priest  now its all miracle rogues taking 10 hours per turn every game  Is someone paying these guys to all flock to one deck Jesus christ  I can find less tryhard meta decks in Ranked than in Casual at this point  disgusting  3  Fuck the heroic chess boss still  worst RNG bullshit I have ever seen  I played 20 games against it where the queen was literally the last card in my deck  Who enjoys that shit I tweeted Ben Brode about this and he said he didnt understand the question when I asked if making players sad that someone would create such an RNGbased boss was their goal  Thats it  fuck
