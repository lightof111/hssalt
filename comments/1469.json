have maximised income from sales of packs as people jump on the cancerwagon  Clearly its a broken set of cards that will end up being played by anyone wanting to ladder quickly  the percentage of pirate decks will get bigger and bigger  blizzard will sit back and take the  as dumb shits play the deck and convince themselves they are adapting to the meta  Once the whole thing is dominated by pirate decks and everyone who is going to play it has the cards and they are making no more easy money  then they will nerf it  Then they will release a new set of unbalanced cards to spike the sales cycle again  You cant rely on building up skill or a card collection of effective decks over time  play the broken decks or get rofflestomped  Know that your broken combos and synergies will be digitally castrated soon so get in while the going is good  The whole experience is poisonous and a gigantic con  It will come out that the matchmaking is rigged too  in time\", \"commentId\":

they were honest about it and kept the current cancer confined to standard  Unfortunately it ruins wild ladder and casual too  The really sad thing is all the Blizzard cheerleaders out there who defend this broken shit and their right to play the broken decks  Those decks are indefensible  We should all craft one and put a bot to work because they are just mindless shit\", \"commentId\":
