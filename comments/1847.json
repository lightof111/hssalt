"[{\"comment\": \"Ill be honest  I dont think I ever posted here  but if there is one thing that makes me salty  is the balance philosophy behind the Rogue quest and Jade Idol I mean  can we get cards that kill aggro too  Make games unwinnable for fast decks and just say Its okay  just play control  The retard backlash would be astronomical  but I guess they could wait five or six months for a slight change that does nothing  Like  I dont know At the start of the game  until both players have 10 mana  restore 5 health to both heroes at the start of each turn  I mean  its okay  because combo and control exist  Honestly  this thought comes to me every time I lose just because I have the wrong archetype against jades or rogues  What bothers me is more the fact that deckkiller cards are only able to exist against slower decks  rather than whatever idiot with no redeeming qualities just won the game  Wheres the equality  Blizzard Thats all\", \"commentId\": \"38713\", \"commentDate\":

he says its shit and is the only truthful one out ther   no need to spend any real money on it  if you do youre the kinda mug they are aiming at  do your daily quests between expansions  get 80 of the

deck token druid  let me tell you one thing this meta is soo fking shit  You cant play slower deck because you get hard countered by Jade druid unbeatable with control deck  quest rogue that OTKs me on turn 56  Quest warrior pretty much lame as jade druid in late game but less cancer  pirate warrior which I dont mind people playing No  Im not playing pirate warrior  midrange paladin  midrange hunter another midrange deck that is also known as My hyena is fking bigger than Deathwing on turn 4 I guess that you get the point So how the duck I should win against something that has better win condition or that kills me on turn 45 if I dont draw well        Its not my fault that they add every expansion 23 God tier cards that people make deck around and just grind  So everyone that blames for playing this token shit please GTFO because we all know you are playing cancer deck too And one more thing all All quest rouge players go burn in bloody hell EditAnyone that ropes me  dont worry I
