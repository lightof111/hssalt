"[{\"comment\": \"Won 11 out of 42 games today  So Im still stuck at rank 5 on EU  which is silly because I got Legend on NA and Asia in less then a week  and tomorrow is the last day of the season  Lost so many games I shouldve won due to coinflips and top decks  Usually Im not salty  but this bad luck spree isnt 1 game  it isnt 1 hour  its isnt even 1 day  but its been going on since saturday  I dont know what it is  but I lose everything that has RNG involved  even its its 9010 in my favour  Everytime I queu a deck I face someone who has a good matchup against me  and when I switch decks to counter those  visa vie  I keep getting all my 5 cards in the opening hand vs Aggro  and topdeck all the useless crap in dire situations  Ragnaros hits the wrong target every single time  Sylvanas keeps stealing my best minion  or his worst  Barnes keeps giving the single most useless card in the deck  Resurrect  Forbidden Shaping  Thoughtsteal  Firelands Portal  Ironforge Portal  Swashburglar and what not keep getting the worst outcomes possible  Its not so much that my RNG is bad  but its that the opponents RNG is always good  I mean Knife Jugglers  Flamewakers and shit keep hitting the things the need in order to turn games around  Sigh  this is one of the few times I actually want to throw my computer out the window  because Hearthstone  in its core  has nothing to do with skill  the luckiest player will always win\", \"commentId\": \"28564\", \"commentDate\": \"1480466894\"}, {\"comment\": \"First post from a relative newb 2 moths played   I know rank 10 is no big deal for most of you  but Ive been kissing the edge of it all week and its pissing me off   Saturday I started off at rank 11 with one game to go to hit rank 10   Had a lousy weekend for luck  went on a couple of bad losing streaks and dropped all the way back to 16  by Sunday night yeah  seriously   Managed  to claw my way back to one win from rank 10 today and could just taste it  and what do I get  Cthun warrior that I dropped all the way to 4 health that ended up having 35 armor by the time he finally beat me  a zoo warlock with a fantastic opening that killed me on turn 5  and a reno hunter that let me run myself down to one card in hand getting him into one turn kill range before he popped his reno      I gave up at that point and decided to play around in casual for the rest of the night  and the servers went down for maintenance   Sometimes you just cant flipping win Btwmost of my games were played on my tempo mage  which is pretty much identical to the one Pavel used in the world championship  I also have a copy of his shaman deck  but in my experience its pretty inconsistent on the ladder  probably because everyone else is so used to shamans that they know what to expect\",
