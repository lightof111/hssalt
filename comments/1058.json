deck and the people who play it eat babies and talk in the movie theater    Say what you want about Mill Rogue  Face Hunter  Shaman Aggro  or any other deck  at least when you land that lucky topdeck that can save you they actually have to kill it rather than steal it  That and the fact that those decks have a legit strategy rather than Whatever the hell the opponent is playing  Im playing    Yes  its power level is low  but its a dumb fucking deck and I hope the people who enjoy it get cancer\", \"commentId\": \"22074\", \"commentDate\": \"1467129170\"}, {\"comment\": \"I have no sisters  my

a tad every day to do my quest and be done with it to pray I get quests that can get done at the same time so I dont have to play any longer  and if not  just forget it and lose quests  And all this only because I still dont have the gold for the next adventure  If it werent for the  slim  chance that next adventure could solve this  Id just quit the game    Blizzard  Or rather the HS team  as other games can fck up monumentally and still admit it and work to fix it  is killing their game not by making mistakes  but because they consistently show that they dont give a single fck about the mistakes they make\", \"commentId\": \"22078\", \"commentDate\": \"1467136978\"}, {\"comment\": \"Hasnt that been the game since day 1 Is there a different way to win at this game Either way youre in

 VS now with decks based entirely on random effect cards   As to the game faring well  keep in mind its free  being advertised a lot  and indirectly benefits from WoW and Overwatch getting players  Since you instantly receive the incentive to play HS via Battle net    As to finding another game  that was kind of my point  If the game doesnt come back from the Play zoolike or lose approach  Ill just do that\", \"commentId\": \"22080\", \"commentDate\": \"1467138460\"}, {\"comment\": \"Damn my life is so much better literally since i dont play this cancer game that much anymore  I only play it for like 2 hours in 3 days to complete the quests and thats it  I was grinding hard at the start of the month since i really wanted to reach legend just one time  but it was so stressful and i didnt enjoy the game even a little bit  At the end of the month what would i have to show Hey i have reached rank 5 or hey Ive reached legend    yeah who cares rightI am not salty right now but i think this is the right topic to say my opinion on this game  What i wanted to say is that if you feel like shit  depressed  nervous or whatever because of this game just quit or play it only to complete quests so you will have some gold when another expansion will come out and dont waste your time on this game if you dont have the nerves of steel because at the end of the day you get nothing

replacing antiaggro superstars like Zed and Sludgy  Theres just not enough to slow the massive pressure of aggro  tempo  handvomiting the lines are blurred  at this point  and face isnt really the problem  imo and it makes for a very boring game  Ive retreated to arena  but can certainly understand the frustration from anyone that hasnt been playing for a long time to amass gold  dust to sustain arena runs  The brainless hand dumping is so much more prevalent than Ive ever seen  and its there from rank 19 at the start of the season all the way up to 5 by midtolate season\",

that you cant count it in the cost of the card  Flame Imp  32 for 1 mana sets the president for the game  No cheap removal for it  massive shift in the game  Dark Peddler  basically the best 3 drop in the game  which so happens to be great synergy with Zoo  Any good 1 drop have more value per mana than any higher mana cost card  Dr  4  aka Flamewreathed Faceless  77 for 4 mana    just so balanced right If you dont have a removal by turn 4 or 5 then you autolose  Start praying to RNGsus  Tuskarr Totemic  32  34 or amazing card draw is insane  Tunnel Trogg  A guarantee for your opponent to outtempo you  Their 1 drop MUST be removed or it will win the game for them  Doomhammer  A weapon which can end up doing 28 damage if you get the right rockbiter draws  One weapon  28 damage  The entire meta must now counter this  I think that if 90 of the high ranking meta consists of Shamans and Zoo warlocks  8 are decks that rank well because they counter when I say counter I mean they have specially geared decks to stand a better chance than everything else but are at a disadvantage these nobrain aggro decks  The other 2 are other brainless idiot decks like Aggro dragon warrior  or Divine aggro paladin    Perhaps a few Fadral aggro druids  I have been trying to play control decks and trying to formulate interesting and competitive decks  But what can you do when some brainless shaman comes in and kills you on turn 5 because you didnt mulligan every removal in your deck Basically aggro is king and thats that  The ONLY reason that it is semidifficult to get legend rank is because below rank 5 you will face players using the same deck as you  There is my salt  The game is ruined by aggro players\", \"commentId\": \"22085\", \"commentDate\": \"1467144460\"},
