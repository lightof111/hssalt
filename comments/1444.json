cheapass control decks  for that same reason give people the ability to choose between the style they like most  That being said  another option would be making it easier to catch up for new players  because I can play the hell out of most control decks  but those who have joined more lately in the game should also have a chance to play whatever playstyle they like  And no  I dont lose much to aggro  I lose much to druid so Im not complaining on blizzard forcing people to play aggro because I lose to it  but because since patrons nerf the only option for many people to play this game is to go yarr  and that should not be exactly like that  Or I might just be an idealist  Oh  and btw  aggro decks also become inviable by time  How many zoolocks did you see in TGT How many face hunters you see now And face druids How many face warriors you saw before WotOG And so and so  Everything gets outdated  and for low budget players must be tragic both if their outdated deck is control or aggro\", \"commentId\": \"30291\", \"commentDate\": \"1483186221\"}, {\"comment\": \"Title of thread includes Need to blow off steam Just getting really tired of all the whining  so I figured Id do a
