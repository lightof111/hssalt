deadly poison but how likely is that with only 1 or 2 cards in hand The rogue plays Journey Below which gets them a Xaril  Poisoned Mind which gets them Firebloom Toxin for exact lethal with a weapon hit3 times 3 fucking times  Getting a Xaril from Journey Below is god knows what odds  but then for all 3 of them to also win the 1 in 5 to get them the only toxin that guarantees exact lethal The worst part is they were all awful  terrible players  making awful  terrible plays  They could have guaranteed victory 3 turns earlier by making the smart trades  instead they SMORC and then get into the extremely likely position of losing themselves  but who cares about how well you play when you can get the perfect 3 card RNG combo for exact lethal anyway\", \"commentId\": \"23169\",
