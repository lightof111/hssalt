a couple of times Like when I Stormcracked and HP on turn 4 when Jade Lightning was right there  But that was on me  I take responsibility for it  The thing that pissed me off the most was the fact that after the arena was done  I got rewarded a pack usual 40 dust pack shenenigans  Im used to that  50 gold and a Duskboar  Really The gold equivalent of a 23 win arena run and a common For 5 wins Wow  thank you Blizzard  I totally needed that card  as I havent disenchanted like 10 extras of those  And you didnt even have the courtesy of making it golden  at least that would have a good dust refund\", \"commentId\": \"34522\", \"commentDate\": \"1491135933\"}, {\"comment\": \"Hey guys  since if I make a thread about it  theres a good chance that it will be locked  so Im posting it here How do you think the last expansion msog would look like  if there werent any pirates like Patches and STB Im not going to post a salty thread about them  but its kinda silly how two cards  and especially patches  were played in a lot of decks  pirates  aggro  miracle and even in antipirate ones  Now I wont argue  that this is the expansion with the most filler cards  but imo if we ignore the two most used ones  we could see a meta  where the games would have lasted longer  Or at least there would be a bigger variety of decks   Lets look at the three families Jade Lotus  Grimy Goons and the Kabal  The buffing and the building golems mechanics are relatively slow  the kabal cards are also part of this category   Now some people will say  that in a slow meta the jade decks would obviously have the upper hand  but the other decks could find a way to include midrange minions  that can out tempo the jades  People wouldnt be scared  that they would always get punished by fast decks  just because theyve added some costly minions   The game wouldnt have been rockpaperscissors Some neutral minions also offer a lot of late game value  Cards like Doppelgangster  Red Mana Wyrm  Don HanCho arent even that bad  some saw little or no play  just because they were too slow  Imo if there werent cards like the above mentioned ones  a card like Leatherclad Hogleader would be common in many decks  hunter would still be a thing  warrior will use the buff cards for a change  Lotus Assassin would be a great card in some rogue decks and so on  Thank you  for taking your time to read this  So what do you think\", \"commentId\": \"34523\", \"commentDate\": \"1491138647\"}, {\"comment\": \"Rags at it again  Another 14 face while his Rag takes mine down on the first 15 attempt\",

about Hearthstone and it turns out to be a no go  meaning Ill quit the game  In fact  I quit about 2 months ago when I got enough of the aggro dominance but I didnt want to open just another salty  bitchy thread about how this game has gone to a wrong direction and why Im leaving  Instead  I thought Id wait to find out what the next expansion has to offer and see if it changes anything  Im disappointed because they keep supplying shaman the perfect cards to play on curve while seemingly totally abandoning rouge  The moment I saw the new razorpetal cards  especially Razorpetal Volley I knew that I dont want to be a part of it anymore  This card is so frustratingly disappointing because a it does not add any new mechanic to the game but forces rouge players to keep playing miracle which might be strong but isnt fun after 2 years and b its so underpowered that I dont even believe the designers spent more than 5 minutes thinking about this card  The card discussion thread holds numerous ideas about how this could have been a cool card  but Blizzard did not seem to give it a second thought  In fact  I find the recent fancreated cards and mechanics so much better than Blizzards work that I dont understand why this team is still in place  Im disappointed about UnGoro because I hoped it would hold another 4 months of fun for me but it did not  However  I wont whine about Hearthstone  I just think I realised a new thing about the game it wasnt meant to be played for more than a year because it cannot renew itself it still has the very same principles  strategies and mechanics it used to have when I joined  When I saw tripleclass cards in MSoG  I was excited about them and I hoped this expansion would continue printing such cards while also adding something new as well  like new classspecific keywords  or anything really new and fun  The new keyword is just a reuse of two existing mechanics discover  buffing and after a year  Im bored  I had a lot of fun with Hearthstone  but it came to an end\", \"commentId\": \"34526\", \"commentDate\": \"1491142604\"}, {\"comment\": \"rank 18   zoolock with malchezaar and a Shadow Bolt  that already just made me go
