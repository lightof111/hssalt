Northshire Cleric T2 Shrinkmeister T3 Dark Cultist T4 Murloc Knight that I couldnt answer so it escalated out of control  Oh and what did I draw Dart Trap Cat Trick Ice Block Cone of Cold and that sort of BS  Second game Versus a hunter who picked shaman  His card quality was a little bit better than mine  but it wasnt insane like it should be  Then turn 5 came I had an Emperor Cobra on board and he has a Haunted Creeper on board  He plays Baron Rivendare and trades in the Haunted Creeper  Sure  nothing crazy I cant handle  But then he has an Evolve and only gets INSANE quality drops  And the most annoying part was that he had to think about a minute about that turn  Its funny how I often see people recommending tavern brawl for those who want fun games without netdecking  I enjoy games that I win through skill  thought  and actually beating my opponent  and not this BS\", \"commentId\": \"25643\", \"commentDate\": \"1473424214\"}]"
