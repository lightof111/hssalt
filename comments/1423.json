\"Okay Im gonna try this blow off steam thing  I play Dragon Priest mainly and its either the Reno version or the version with Velen in it  While I really enjoy most of my games I simply hate the

people complained about it a lot  I know youre thinking thats not the same thing because you can play 2 copies of it  but hunter really has no efficient card draw  so it wasnt guaranteed that youll be able to have it on turn 8 either  Youre saying inconsistent draw as if Reno decks have no means to draw cards and rely only on topdecks or a good starting hand  Dont give me that shit  please   Dont get me wrong  Id rather play a Reno deck than an aggro deck but thats just my taste right now  If other people want to play aggro  thats their preference and they dont deserve to be called scum  cancer or braindead  Oh  and I dont really think that Reno is broken  I was just saying that if CotW and the pirates are so broken  then Reno is broken  too  Eye for an eye  as poor Uther would say\",

a consequence against aggro  If you are facing a Pirate Warrior and you dont draw into any early game then its game over and you limit your chances of doing that by only running 1 copy of each card  I am not saying that is fair or unfair  I am just stating that this limit reduces the chances of winning against a deck like pirate warrior that can kill you on turn 4 or 5  I agree that aggro decks has their place in the meta  at the moment they are keeping Jade Druids at bay  While I am not a fan of Pirate Warriors and I can get frustrated when they curve perfectly I do respect the deck as a allin deck  I am not a fan of it but I suppose it has its charm  If you were being sarcastic with your reno comment then fair enough  I missed it  Good day to you sir  \", \"commentId\": \"29846\",

there are no real calculations in this game  All you have to do is to take decisions  If the most common decision for that deck is to go face  that doesnt mean its brainless  There are 2 types of
