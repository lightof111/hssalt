"[{\"comment\": \"Whenever I see someone say something is easy  I think of all the people that still screw it up  Play all your minions before killing my Abomination  Check  Mindvision a Flamestrike from my hand  play all your minions  Check  Play a hits both boards AOE before attacking with your minions  Check  Hitting a Nightmared minion for maximum efficiency  Check  Hitting my face with your Deaths Bites last charge before inflicting the rest of your supposedly lethal damage  giving me tons of armour because of Armorsmith  making me dodge lethal before I take back the game because you spent all your ressources dealing meaningless face damage  Check  Drawing a fckton in a freeze mage mirror  Check  It was cool meeting your ice block  a shame fatigue didnt like it    You can claim this game is easy all your want  and playing mindless decks certainly helps in that sense  but many many people are still failing at it  so here you go  This is the same as saying WoW is easy by defeating its lowest difficulty  Then you see those people in higher difficulties and they rage quit at the first wipe  Or are kicked because they caused it \", \"commentId\": \"23281\",

harder decks this game has to offer and it is not as easy as people make it out to be  Btw  if i invest lets say  8 hours a day into a game like Overwatch  which pros do  i dont  then they become good through time investment  So its basically the same like in HS  Why is that one might ask Because its all about muscle memory  team composition  map knowledge  All that is learned by investing lots of time in it  You can apply that to any game basically  Time is always a factor  like always\", \"commentId\": \"23284\", \"commentDate\": \"1469704281\"}, {\"comment\": \"So    tech in 2x Eater of

least give this game a sense of balance and give and idea of hope to players like me who doesn t play only garrosh  zoolock  aggro shaman or rexxar  makepriestgreatagain\", \"commentId\": \"23291\",

and going face interaction according to Blizzard Oh of course  this is their new approach of design because any other interaction would be too confusing for new players  Lets make the cheapest and dumbest decks in the game be the best  Screw those people who invested in Naxx for options against snowballing  that would give them an edge against 1 week old accounts with Zoo and Face Shaman as
