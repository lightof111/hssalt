3 viable lists still and no nerfs was a mistake  A deck should not be this well rounded  Paladin has The best heals in standard Forbidden Healing  Ragnaros  Lightlord  Truesilver Champion  Lay on Hands whereas the class that should be healing is Priest  arguably The single best Minion in the game for value Tirion Fordring Tremendous synergy with the best Old God Nzoth The best draw spells in the game Divine Favor  Solemn Vigil  Lay on Hands Amazing removal options Aldor Peacekeeper  Equality  Keeper of Uldaman The best mana curve in the game A deck should not be this wellrounded  it is simply unhealthy for the game  Proper design would see that there is a weakness  and so far the only weakness that I have seen and exploited with these decks is the skill of the pilots or just luck  Some of them are absolutely terrible  but I never felt like I actually won a real fight against any paladin list  Shaman is B S  too  but at least it is less consistent and more exploitable than
