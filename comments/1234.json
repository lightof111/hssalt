Im playing against some sort of Yogg druid  Ive got a pretty solid board  he has 2 cards in hand  He plays out Violet Teacher and Mulches one of my fatties giving me the mighty Millhouse Manastorm and passes  If I play Millhouse Ill set up lethal unless he draws exactly Nourish into Swipe and Wrath or so I thought  His turn topdecked Nourish  Nourish  Swipe  Arcane Giant  Arcane Giant  Power of the Wild  mark of the wild on a 99 giant into hero power with all his mana bar 2 left over  Faaaark It was pretty sweet play  I guess  but shitty way to lose  Probably would have won a turn later if I
