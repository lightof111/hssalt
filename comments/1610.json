innovative decks on ladder and running into Pirate Warrior and ANY variation of Shaman   Its amazing to me the that out of the seemingly endless amount of people that btch about those decks  some of

NOTHING in the game that can counter this  and I main rogue so I have LOADS of cheap spells and STILL cant stop it   The game is over by this point  and I rarely ever play against a Pirate Warrior that doesnt have a starting hand that somewhat resembles this    Midrange Shaman at least takes a few turns to develop   BUT HOW DOES SOMEONE HAVE FUN PLAYING EXACT COPYPASTE DECKS FROM THE INTERNET THAT LITERALLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE PLAYING   I get it that you want to win  but youre literally being a mindless twat by copypasting a deck from the internet and playing cards on curve   Theres 0 skill to it and its pathetic  Im not done ranting because I know as soon as I fire it back up  Ill run into 15 more Midrange ShamansPirate Warriors in my next 20 games   Ill get the occasional Jade Druid  Renolock  or Dragon Priest  but it makes the game far from fun playing the same thing over  and over  and over again\", \"commentId\": \"33814\", \"commentDate\": \"1489844558\"}, {\"comment\":
