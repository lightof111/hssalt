Might want to heal so you dont die to topdecked Pyroblast  Shaman or druid has pretty decent board Clear it so the Savage Roar or Bloodlust is now a waste of card space   In response to the following postAgain  Same thing  Think How is this play going to be punished If it does get punished is there a better alternative In your case I assume its a Pirate Warrior  If you are holding a Pyromancer and two spells then you may want to save them for a pretty good clear instead of a tempo play   Playing a Pyromancer by itself is pretty likely to get punished anyways because there are just so many ways to deal 2 dmg  tbh that was probably a stupid play  Last thing   Ive seen you complain about losing with and against every single meta deck  Heres some advice STICK TO A FUCKING DECK   My friend managed to get to legend with Dragon Priest of all decks because he stuck with it the whole season  Sure  if you reach a rank where a certain deck is running rampant then  and ONLY then  change to a counter deck   P S I wrote this while crushing the hopes of a young murloc paladin with freeze mage  So no  Paladin is not unbeatable\", \"commentId\": \"37236\", \"commentDate\": \"1494659763\"},

its too wonky or reliant on good draws  i ditch it   if it simply not good  i ditch it   everything  LITERALLY EVERYTHING  ive attempted to play this month has been a massive failure    did you not read the part where ive hit 5 many times before  and hit 3 last month  its not like i just picked up the game yesterday   also for the MILLLIONTH GODAMNED TIME this is not the thread where im asking
