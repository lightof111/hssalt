I won this game  so Im having kind of mixed feelings right now  But holy shit  how did The Caverns Below pass the testing phase I just played a game where I had a nearly perfect opening with turn two Imp Gang Boss  turn three another one  turn four Crystalweaver and turn 5 another Crystalweaver  This was the situation at that point  This board was almost fully cleared on turn 6 except for a single imp which died the next turn  Before being killed by Boars and Patches attacking multiple times it was capable of putting my opponent at 9 health  Turn 6 Demonwrath  turn 7 Enforcer  My opponent built another board out of nothing which ate a Twisting Nether  Turn 9 I played a Healbot  and still when I killed my opponent on turn 10 with a Voidcaller she was afraid to kill  a Darkbomb and another Enforcer she had a lethal on the board  There arent even control decks that can consistently clear this kind of board  There are a few aggro decks that can give this opening a run for their money  Having an almost full board cleared at two consecutive turns in a row  its highly unlikely for any other deck to still build a threatening board  Quest Rogue just did all of those things with a mediocre draws\", \"commentId\": \"38191\", \"commentDate\": \"1496063237\"}, {\"comment\": \"Dear reader  if you are not in the mood for a cheesy  soapopera text  then  please  skip this post   Yesterday I came up across a Kripps video and couldnt help but notice a very interesting comment  Now  if you are not in the mood for some reading  then dont hate the person for taking their time writing it  So anyway the user Lard Master talks about how bad the carddesign of hs really is  They give an example with the choices we have to make  they comment  that some of the cards have so high power level  but are so simple  that even a nobrainer wont have any trouble using them  The example was a 4 mana 35 divine shield taunt aka Tolvir Stoneshaper  Not hating on this card  just making an example theres no thought  when playing it  You have a pimped minion  which you can play on curve  why wouldnt you play it You might lose the buff  Or with Drakonid Operative  if you want  And the user said  that many times the one player can play cards like this  wo having the need to think of a better strategy  while the other player has to scratch his head thinking about how best to answer that card   Today I beat a control paladin  I want to say  that I was very pleased with the game  A normal control vs control match  hybrid shaman vs Nzoth pala  The game lasted around 15 minutes  I can honestly say  it was a close game  We both tried to make the better plays and to preserve our resources as much as possible  I want to add  thank you  pala  for the great game  Anyway right in the next game I had to fight a mage  The game ended very quick with a loss  because my opponent got good answers thanks to RNG like book from a glyph and another glyph from the book and removals  And Im just fed up with this  constantly losing to BS or to bad carddesign  Its not fair to try to think a whole game and this part not to be relevant  Its not fair to try to spend a lot of time in a match  to try to win it and with the next 2minute game to lose the previous goal  Im just fed up with this  You also agree  that this shouldnt be the case  right  So now Im looking for another card game  Dont know  if it will be Gwent because it got popularized so much or sth else  but I want to play a real and a fair game  Im still going to play hs casually  I like the appearance  but the game is such a fucking joke to me  If someone actually read it  thx for your time\", \"commentId\": \"38192\", \"commentDate\": \"1496063355\"}, {\"comment\": \"If you see I am doing a fucking quest in CASUAL
