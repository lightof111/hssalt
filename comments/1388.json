ago I disenchanted some golden epics and rares to receive dust for MSoG cards  I was so hyped to build these Reno decks  that I accidentally crafted a golden rare which costs 800 dust  Before I recognised it it was too late to undo this  so I had to disenchant it again so I wasted 700 dust for nothing  just because 2 misclicks   As Blizzard support is not restoring gold nor dust for these kind of accidents the dust is lost and I was not able to craft the decks I wanted  I have more golden cards  but these are the ones I do not want to disenchant  because they look too good  P S  With so many new fun decks I hate to see that braindead decks like Pirate Warrior get pushed even more  How can people playing these decks even have a little fun with HS\", \"commentId\": \"29097\",
