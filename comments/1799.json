"[{\"comment\": \"If only the people playing netdecks knew how sad and pathetic they look when they start popping emotes when their deck gets the upper hand  I mean I look at yet another murloc Paladin or yet another midrange hunter or yet another curator Pally or yet another quest rogue and I instantly think shit heres another sad little cunt desperate to win  but clearly no better than me because they are the same rank as whatever junky homebrew deck Im running  I give them the benefit of the doubt and they stagger through the match on autopilot and if its a cancer deck they will probably get to a winning position  And then the emotes start  Understand this  you play a comon netdeck youve already branded yourself as a bit thick and a bit desperate  The only vile shit worse is Ben Brode who has let the game get to this state   Just take your win and leave the emotes alone\", \"commentId\": \"37712\", \"commentDate\": \"1495247942\"}, {\"comment\": \"Look here you salt piles
