complained about it  too  But  to be fair  there could be at least 3 reasons for it  they might be on some quest  like the play X cards of some type sort they might be trying to level up their hero

do as we please on our turn  When you play a game  you play for yourself  not for others  Therefore  as much as I agree with you on how unsportsmanlike this is  I always remind myself that it is the other players right to take all the time he wants on his turn  enjoy his win and play all the cards he can  I dont agree with it when it comes to BM but if the player is just doing it for his own pleasure    theres really nothing we can do but to concede and move on    Not everything ppl do is aimed at BMing others\", \"commentId\": \"36476\", \"commentDate\": \"1493819050\"}, {\"comment\":

tattoo a russian doge on myself  I mean at least its not a dick  but still its weird to explain  I guess its good if russia ends up owning the us though  I can just be like nah look bro Soviet for life brah  And as a tattoo apprentice I can always use the practice so thats cool too I guess   but still  Why Russian Doge I wish angry chicken would have won Or like some ragnaros line art would of
