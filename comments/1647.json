Maly Kun Druid were kind of absurd 1   Jade Druid Ramped like a madman and had 44 Jades by turn 4 with like 7 mana  topdecked Nourish to replenish his hand  drew exclusively bigger Jades and Fandral to power up every other card he played  Loss 2  Meme Shaman looked like a JadeYShaarjCrusher sort of list with Goya Game is going okay  a bit in his favor but Ive got most of my combo pieces and some draw in hand to close things rapidly  I mulch his Ysera  receive a Thank You  YShaarj comes down with the tag Created by Mulch  and he pulls a YShaarj from the deck  I see I can hold for another turn and set up to do so  I draw dead  Loss  3  Pirate Warrior  I dont draw earlygame  Loss  4  Renolock  Easy matchup  he doesnt apply pressure all game  I assemble my combo pieces other than Kun and start drawing toward the bottom of my deck  Kun is my last card  Next turn I have lethal  Dirty Rat pulls my Malygos the only card I 100 needed to secure the game out of six minions in my hand from hand  Twisting Nether  I all in on the board since its my only option  MC Tech steals my Alex  Defender of Argus creates a wall  I punch through  have lethal next turn  Blastcrystal Potion and Demonwrath clean me out  He still has like 10 cards in his deck  Im in fatigue with no cards in hand or on the board  Loss  I dont think Hearthstone wants to see me today  Part of the experience I
