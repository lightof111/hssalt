played 20ish games in wild today  and the only wild cards have been on my side of the board  Nothing but fucking netdecked standard cancer  In Wild  Fuck this   If Blizzard want to support Wild mode  make it so you have to have fucking Wild cards in your deck to play in Wild  Im sick and tired of this retardation\", \"commentId\": \"32904\", \"commentDate\": \"1488223736\"}, {\"comment\": \"Do you

geting better  Its 100 PURE luck anor playing a cancer deck   No skill  no creativity  no nothing   Its just a fancy game of war  you hope to draw what you need and hope your matchup is good   If it is  you win  if it isnt you lose  Legend is ALL about the deck   Cancer decks win games and get legend  NOT players   Thats why its so bad   If they wouldmake changes that actually rewarded deck

 Once in a while I see a jade Druid and a Reno deck   All are equally disgusting  This game has been out for three years or more at this point   Youd think theyd test the game for a while before releasing cards and or expansions  How hard is it They could have seen how horribly overpowered pirates are  Could have easily figured out that the unlimited jade buff decks are ridiculous  As for Reno   what another horrible mistake  Geezus its so fucking bad   There is zero incentive to even dare try your own deck  Casual Yeah right   thats loaded with try hards too   I realize the defenders and other blizzard sheep will say whats wrong with playing overpowered decks  Well  the problem is that it makes the game suck  No one expects or feels they should win every game with their home brewed deck   But  for fucks sake  can we at least have a chance Can we at least have an enjoyable game Nope  you are run over by turn 2 or if you manage to live for a while against a jade deck or some Reno bull shit then you simply die a few turns later   Or  Reno resets the work youve done at the flick of a card  Real fucking interesting  Godo job  The game can still be very fun even if you lose  Losing is NOT the problem  The problem is losing automatically to dooshbag deck after dooshbag deck which are all the same are completely brainless and skill less  Gimme a break\",

{\"comment\": \"Im not going to go judge the new set already  because weve obviously only seen the tip of the tip of the iceberg so far  But I just hope they dont fall into the same trap they did the previously  namely indirectly prebuilding decks  This is already a problem with the evergreen classic sets your deck already starts with a few cards you put in anyway because theyre too strong  but they keep adding it in expansions too  Want a jade deck You have to throw in the obvious jade cards  Pirate decks You have to throw in the obvious pirate cards  Handbuff yes those exist Throw in the obvious handbuff cards  Reno Once again  the story repeats itself  So if you want to build a deck your room for creativity is limited by A The classic cards you have to put in because theyre too strong and B The obvious cards you have to put in for the archetype you want  Quests seem to follow this line atleast if theyre all like the priest one  Want to build a priestquest deck or whatever you call it Throw in the classic cards  the quest card  and the strongest deathrattle cards available to priest which are fairly obvious\", \"commentId\": \"32915\", \"commentDate\": \"1488283684\"},
