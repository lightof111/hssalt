I made a midrange hunger deck and gained ten levels in about five hours  It felt like I won 80 percent of my games  Then I get to level 5 and  now Im losing 80 percent of my games  I used to play unranked for some easy competition and now even there I just go up against insane decks  I dont really know why I won so much or got such a high level but now the game isnt fun at all because I just cant compete\", \"commentId\": \"35742\", \"commentDate\": \"1492742931\"}, {\"comment\": \"Sad little fuck who played Quest Rogue and roped every turn soon as they got the upper hand\",

about the game development  which will really makes sense to the avg  to new player in this horrid game Im not so mad at any players  but getting through my thirtieth lost in an evening is really boring  Im thinking the developers dont know how to make a game that is fun  competitive and can be learned by most  other than real fanatic types  So really not mad at the players  just mad at the cheating that goes on in the program and the developers of the game itself  This game is really starting to suck  because its becoming a shear money grab  and shame on blizzard for that  I try to enjoy playing so before you wannabe genius types spout off about how bad a player I am  just remember  its new players coming in that help the game continue  and yes I am not an accomplished player  but that shouldnt be a reason to rip on me  Rip on the developers  who only catering to young people  lots of money and time  or anyone with just money  Oh and how much they can screw over their player base  and thats because they dont care one way or the other  I only play this game now to try to enjoy playing a card game and to get the perksachievements  Which btw or becoming harder and harder to get  Im still at 22 from 23 this month  after losing a shit ton of games  including a deck I copied from this site  This really is boring  and its sad  So think what you want  but this game was better at one time  now its just about money and how many stupid card combos a person can play to destroy the opponent  as quick as possible  I wish I had some answers  but I dont  because I dont know enough about how card games work in deep theory    I just know the game cheats at some level  or takes the advantage  because it has all the moves programmed in  Random in programming is not necessarily random sometimes  So to the people who play  try to have fun if you can  To those who agree even a little  good luck  To those who dont agree  well  cool  but thats your problem  AND to the developers  go HANG yourselves and DIE   Beyoctches\", \"commentId\": \"35746\", \"commentDate\": \"1492748260\"}, {\"comment\": \"This meta is already 100 cancer   you simply cannot play an
