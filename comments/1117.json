ridiculous  but thats already an overused catchphrase of mine  so I think its better to consider brawl as a clear all your opponents minions card  A bit too much value for 5 mana I would say  but its still more reasonable than understanding how it is even close to remotely being fuckin possible to be this fuckin unlucky like I am  Of course I never draw my brawls against the retarded face decks spilling their entire hand out before turn 5\", \"commentId\": \"23330\", \"commentDate\": \"1469791311\"}, {\"comment\": \"to be fair  he is no win condition\", \"commentId\": \"23331\",

{\"comment\": \"They are extremely hard to deal with because as my post a few up for yours states     They have every answer imaginable and always have them in hand    Your early minions dont last because of fiery war axe which they always have   Your mid game usually doesnt work either due to more weapons  more great removal or a combination of the two   Then your big  late game minions get quickly removed with execute and shield slam which are by FAR the most amazingly effective and cheap removal cards ever   What about board clears  No problem for warriors   They have brawl which for 5 lousy mana gets rid of basically everything and seems to always lave your 11 minion alive    never rags or your big guns LOL    Theres more   That stupid fucking armor   It get stacked and piled up faster than wheat germ at a flour mill   You cant get rid of it either   Even when they use shield slam it doesnt cost any armor   Its ridiculous  advice  Draw your nuts and pray they draw like crap   Most warrior decks right now are unbeatable unless they play terribly or you draw a perfect opener using a counter deck like midrange Hunter or midrange shaman   Thats the sad truth\", \"commentId\":
