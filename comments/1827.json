this time is to play aggro  Currently saving dust to craft Rogue quest  Cant beatem so Im going to Joinem  btw Bliz  When there are 135 cards total in your expac and my 50 packs of 5 only gets me half of the cards and 1 of the corner cards of the xpac your algorithm for determining randomness is badly broken recommend you fix that before next or not another penny youll get from me  Prove it with the pacs I buy with gold that I have to work for on the daily  Please dont let me down I actually kinda like this game and its my mobile game of choice when Im not at my PC playing WoW  I cant help but feel highly penalized for not having played this from day 1  started in October of 15 and spent the usual amount you r would pay to play a new game these days  fun level is starting to go down as I increasingly face armies of legionaries that I could only wish that I could lucky enough to get in pacs or could have acquired had I been here since the beginning  Again matchmaking needs to take into account at least the dust cost of the deck  Now I understand that dust cost of QR is very low but seriously pally decks that are any goodand they are really good have a cost upward of 6000 dust at the cheapest  Welp cant play that class I guess  Also Silence Priests  Pirate fags  and Evo shammys FUCK OFF I will fight your ass down to the last hp and then ropequit before I die  Quest Rogues enjoy the turn one concedes cause Im just done trying  seeing that quest just makes me tired  oh yeah and I have noticed that yall wait until turn 3 or 4 just to play the quest so I confuse you for a miracle rogue because you only get to play with yourself anymore or circle jerk with another QR  no worries assholes I will be there soon too but until then lick me where I shit\", \"commentId\":
