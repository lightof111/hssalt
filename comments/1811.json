ice block   Im at 16 health and have played around almost all of their burn 2 pyroblast  2 fireballs  2 frost bolts   2 Medivhs Valet  1  firelands portal   Wouldnt you know it  Primordial Glyph into ANOTHER Pyroblast   Boom down to 6   I pop their block  and am ready to end it   Nope  They top deck their Second Firelands Portal   These losses suck so much because you cant learn anything  I anticipated his moves  I played around their face burn   I kept a strong hold of the board   I oozed his Atiesh i knew hed run Medivh   I held ALL of my heal in my hand  and played it when I knew they were in burn combo range the deck Im using is in my signature   Not to speak too highly of myself  but I was far and away the better player and I lose   Top decks are going to happen Ive been on the fortunate side of them  but casting a 2 mana spell  discovering a 10 mana spell that gets a discount allowing them to launch it that turn   Thats bad   Its awful design  and it punishes players who actually play with skill   It also just adds to the frustration when that was the win you needed to rank up   Sorry everyone  Ill try to be done bitching today   Just needed to get one more good rant

still terrible unless you grind the top tier meta decks  You will NEVER get another dollar from me Blizzard until you make it so the socalled meta decks are not so ridiculously superior to  other builds  until you code in an autosquelch feature so I dont have be emote triggered by the fuckwits that run those decks  and until you implement some sort of penalty for repeated rope burning for the retarded slow thinkers and sulkers out there    Balance and player friendly features is all I want  Ungoro has some cool cards but overall it sucks  Hearthstone could be good but overall it sucks

tactics which involve killing you asap  I dont think this game will ever change  What i find confusing are opponents you meet in casual game mode  For 3 weeks now ive been playing only casual and the variety of decks is insane  Ofc from time to time i still meet pirate warrior  burst mage or any kind of mage really because mage is pure luck class atm quest rogue or any other frustrating bullshit form constructed but then i just concede at turn 12  If you dont like the opponent youre faciing in casual just concede on turn 1  There is nothing wrong with this  Treat it like built in game
