are a bad player  Brawl is simply a strong card against decks that vomit minions onto the board  and excavated evil and ghoul arent good against shaman on their own at all  Auchenai circle is a two card combo  and even if they have it shaman often doesnt have trouble refilling the board  They have enough earlygame to draw  Such as trogg  which we can all aggree on is 100 balanced  totem golem  tuskarr  feral spirit etc  Another card is thing from below  Well  if you want it to be 0 mana you have to summon enough totems  Except tuskarr and totem golem are ridiculously strong on their own  I do think shaman deserved results  but no class deserves to be broken  But let me ask you a question Why do you like shaman When was the last time you actually had to make a tough decision It feels to me like you are trying to justify playing a broken deck  Shaman is broken  and I dont know any pro player who denies it\", \"commentId\": \"21572\", \"commentDate\": \"1465897839\"}, {\"comment\": \"Shaman is hardly broken  and you also dont know any pro player who cant beat it  because its not hard  I enjoy shaman because its got fun cards  If Im playing shaman  its mostly reno shaman in wild  so I have to make plenty of tough decisions  And Ghoul is admittedly not as good on its own  but implying excavated doesnt destroy a shaman is either ignorance or denial  And I lived through the nightmare of secret paladin  dont even try to lecture me on saying no class deserves to be broken  that bullshit was so much worse  Just because shaman is tier one doesnt make it broken  it just means its good  and thats a good thing\", \"commentId\": \"21573\", \"commentDate\": \"1465900708\"}, {\"comment\": \"So i was playing midrange shaman  First opponent hunter everything in my favor  Had board control had more hp   guess what plays YoggDerpon his yogg gets charged buffed and does 14 dmg to my face  Ok no big deal still had lethal on board right  Nope last spell from yogg frozen nova   procceed to concede       Well I guess it s just bad rng right  So i head out to the second game  Againts mage   not trying to be an asshole but the guy played both his mana wyrnns in a turn againts a shaman who most likely has lightning storm  So he gets punished but his flamewaker plus some random dmg hit my face a couple o times im at 9 hp after when he just went face with his fireball not clearing anything  But he had nothing on board guess what he plays        RetardSaron Lava Burst my face Feral Rage for a grand total of 9 lethal fin dmg to my face  Really considering playing those cancer warlock and hunter decks if rng is gonna do this kind of bullshit  And wtf is that card YoggSaron   who in their right mind would design a card like that  Like i try hard thinking about what to play next and do better than my opponent   in the end all he does is go face twice with two fireballs hits me a couple of times with random flamewaker dmg and then yoggs when he is about to lose and wins cuz he gets to cast a million spells for 10 mana  Oh lets make a fun interactive card that will piss everybody off  Hearthstone HQ  Someone should say to blizzard what scara said to riot It s fkin horrible every expansion in this game makes it worse to play  And wtf is wrong with arena i keep retiring my decks cuz my drafts are shitty as f\", \"commentId\": \"21574\", \"commentDate\":

back Today no more Warriors  just Shamans and guess what theyre all retarded I wonder how some people can be so bad at playing this game and still have those Legend card backs     Once again I was sitting at 20 HP while he was at 9  I had a full board and he had nothing beside that stupid Hammer which isnt even the real problem imo next turn of course Im dead to 2xRockbiter Weapon and Lava Burst     Cmon Blizzard didnt you nerf Druid combo cause it was uninteractive and could kill from 15 HP from an empty board How is this fair Theres not even one Deck that completely annihilates Aggro Shaman     I mean even Patron had its awful MU  why does this st have to have at least 4060 against any Deck I thought Standard would make the meta more Controlfriendly and its undeniable that WOTOG released some nice Control cards the problem is that unless youre playing against Warrior theres no way youll get to play those cards  cause youd be dead well before being able to do so     I always hated and will always hate losing to Huffer so I dont really like dying to Call of the Wild especially after having to deal with the most broken 6 drop in the game but Midrange is the only acutally viable Hunter Deck so Im more or less fine with it but then you face Zoo and Shaman and dont even wonder why you play this game  but why those who play those Deck do     I just cant understand how someone can find vomiting his whole hand on the board and praying his opponent doesnt have AOE which most of the times is not even that useful fun     I get there are people who dont like 30 minutes games and people who dont have the ridiculous amount of dust needed to craft Control Warrior so they play faster Decks  but God at least put some dignity in doing so    Theres no need to waste a minute thinking whether playing your 1 drop is a good idea or not or keep spamming emotes when you have turn 6 lethal just cause you overextended and didnt get punished for it     I dont care if the next Adventure sucks  I just want it to release a damn actually playable neutral Healing minion and a something like a mini Soggoth so that stupid Aggro Decks will have to waste some damage in removing it      Also Im on my knees pleading you Ben Brode make it so that Rockbiter Weapon cant target the Hero as well\", \"commentId\": \"21575\", \"commentDate\": \"1465903145\"}, {\"comment\":
