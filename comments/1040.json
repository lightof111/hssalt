have this useless ladder called Wild as a sorry excuse not to refund all of you who gave us money  By the way Piloted Shredder  Sludge Belcher and Dr  Boom were a bit too powerful  so we decided to print a 4 mana 77  a 3 mana 15 for an already broken archetype that is almost impossible to remove and will just continue to grow  and a legendary that will punish all control players by bringing back all threats they dealt with once again  we call it Nzoth  Enjoy  and remember  face is the placeSince turn 1  the game is nothing but coinflips   Fuck this\", \"commentId\": \"21693\",

Conjurers  Flamewakers  Fireballs  Frostbolts and I had board control with Ysera on the field while he had nothing and I was also pretty safe at 22 life  He plays Yogg and he Entombs my Ysera  casts Spreading Madness that hits me for 6  casts Fireball and hits me  casts Arcane Intellect for the mage  Lightning Bolts my face and puts 3 secrets in play for the mage  I then spend my turn killing Yogg and armoring up  Opponent emotes Hello and proceeds to Pyroblast Tome me in the face for lethal   Game 2 CWarrior vs Yogg Hunter  Opponent had 4 minions in the field remnants from Call of the Wild and an Elekk and also an Azure Drake  I had Rag and Soggoth in the field and I was sitting at 16 health  Opponent has 0 cards in his hand and topdecks Yogg and he Entombs my Rag  Pyroblasts me in the face  Eviscerates my face  gives my opponent 4 attack from that 3 mana druid card and then lethals me with Sinister Strike  I am clearly not as skilled as my opponents because whenever I play Yogg he ends up killing himself and doing damage to my face while leaving the opponents board nearly untouched\", \"commentId\": \"21694\", \"commentDate\": \"1466195869\"}, {\"comment\": \"Guaranteed to

there will be Aggro shaman and Zoolock Changed to a antiaggro deck to own Aggro Shaman and Zoolock  there will be 100 Control warriors and priest it was custom deck I made and pretty powerful against aggro  90 win Changed again to control deck  fuck it  you know it  Why the do I have 10 games that specific hero countered me in a row and when I changed it another 10 games that counters me again that even doesnt make sense I feel its made this way intentionally and I am never ever lucky in this game  why 10 games exactly even  I could record video and show how much Im never lucky in this game  5 deadly shots in a row vs 2 minions always kill nontaunt minion why the none of the five deadly shots hit on just 2 minions Atleast get me the hell out of this losing streaks  Also why the fuck people are overreactive whenever I play shaman they start to rope FOREVER as if I dont play a fucking aggro and priest just started saying wow everytime he killed my minions even he just used shadow word pain  people like him should stay in Call of Duty and waste their money on DLCs  Fuck Yoggsaron played him 3 times a row and lost and their yoggsaron just win instantly against my large minions board thanks to astral spell for Druid and completely wins just by absolutely doing nothing the entire game and play small minions at late game  seriously I could have invited him and beat him if he doesnt play yoggsaron anytime  Everytime Im against mage she has a fucking coin that has to do with flamewaker and arcane missles or whatever she brings it out  blizzard should remove a coin from her if she has a flamewaker on her hand or deck  Honestly paladin 2 cards left in the hand  always a fucking equality and consecration So I decided to go back to Wild and My sneed always gets a 17  this has been a third time for real  its not in a row though but I do not lie   I am never ever lucky in this game\", \"commentId\": \"21710\", \"commentDate\": \"1466241303\"}]"
