"[{\"comment\": \"Because it psychologically distances yourself from accepting the responisibility of losing  or the possibility that someone else could be better than you at something  This is pretty natural and occurs everywhere in any form of competitive activity really  Its not a good characteristic or habit to get into  but we definitely all do it at times  Ive often caught myself muttering Neverlucky under my breath when I see the opponent pulling off stupid 1in10 pings with an RNG spell  effect  when I struggle to win simple 5050 targets at times   I can certainly understand the emotive behind the sentiment  though the reality is that it is also natural to give minimal remembrance to the times we did pull off something crazylucky and choose only to acknolwedge when it doesnt

absolutely nothing in this game now  I pushed to legend again this season because I had too much time and I love playing Midrange Hunter and Taunt Warriors  While still at low legend it is fucking unbelievable  how BAD those players are  Two time today Ive met people where I still cant believe they did not let their 5yo brain damaged kid play the game for them  When people who are terrible as fuck are able to reach the highest rank in a game and misplay with decks like Zoolock the game is not a good game  That is what Hearthstone has become  A Casual clusterfuck for braindead Monkeys And I found it curious to get legend with a really good winrate  No longer wondering after seeing that people like this are able to get legend\", \"commentId\": \"36229\", \"commentDate\": \"1493379149\"},

season of Hearthstone Ive had for years  The meta netdecks  are too abundant and too efficient  So bored of facing Pirate Warrior  quest rogue  taunt warrior  beastrattle hunter  I dont know why people bother  they may as well connect their accounts to a bot  There is no skill or fun in grinding those decks  yet thats what most people play  I cant even be bothered messing with decks   its just so depressing seeing the bullshit emotes and the BM delay of lethal from yet another carbon copy meta deck pilot  Ben Brode has sunk to a new level of incompetence with this expansion  IF you got your rank playing one of those decks it means nothing  Your achievement is even less than nothing  If you emoted at all during the match beyond a greeting at the start  you are a cunt plain and simple  Cant stand it any longer   Im out for a week  At least I havent paid money for this shit for at least a year  Still no autosquelch  Still no penalty for rope abuse  Still no fix for transparently broken decks  Still no way to avoid the shitty sewage flow of those decks coming at you on ladder\", \"commentId\": \"36231\", \"commentDate\": \"1493382375\"}, {\"comment\": \"Hover your mouse to the

him rebuild his board using most of his cards  then blow it up again  The patience is taking that 15 20 damage like a man before the nuking the board  instead of panicing and playing DFP immediately
