messing around with a deck I came up with myself rather than netdeck like every Lyra priest who basically just took the deck from here  Anyway  comes down to us having 1 card left each    his last card was generated by Lyra the Sunshard  mine was a 1414 Swamp King Dred  the priest had 12 health  was dead basically unless that last card was heal or a death  SO I play Swamp King Dred  buffs it with Dinomancy up to a 1616  Priest turns comes up    guess what the Lyra the Sunshard generated card was fucking Mind Control  all hail these mediocre players who literally rely on RNG to win games

comrhearthstonecomments65q7yqteam5addressesquestroguebasicallysaysits Just look at the comments  what    the    fucking    fuck    how can anyone with even half a brain defend this quest Its okay because having a full board of 55s with charge on turn 3 happens only 48 of the time instead of above 50 So basically blizzard is fine with it  the players are fine with it  I guess I go fuck myself then  At least I thought there was a tiny chance it will get nerfed but nope  apparently people actually enjoy this  maybe the MSG pirate meta has fried their brains\", \"commentId\": \"35481\",

everything  or ifwhen that fails  good old rng will save the day for them  I am sure the same conditions probably apply to whenever I manage to win  I feel that luck vs skill has reached the point
