\"1490657421\"}, {\"comment\": \"1  I hate Drakonid OP  pulled two Tirions from my deck Im playing oldschool style Midrange Paladin  my favourite class and  deck  for fun  Im at rank 15  play maybe a couple of games each day and dont want to bother investing more time into it to get higher  I know the devs thought that Dragon Priest should go out with 1 last hurrah but the card is fucking stupid and the reason for making such a card is even more stupid 2  Ive been watching the new Paladin card releases for the last couple of weeks  doesnt solve any of Paladins problems  Over the last year Blizzard tried to make Paladins into a reactive class and gave it cards like Wickerflame  Rag Lightlord  Forbidden Healing  Unfortunately they forgot to give it the tools it needs to be a successful reactive class  namely good removal and good AoE cards  Keeper of Uldaman requires a minion or a weapon to trade with in addition to the Keeper of Uldaman card itself  theyve stuck Paladins with Equality Consecrate for 3 years now  a combo which seems OP but the reality is that neither of them do enough on their own  Equality again has the same problem as Keeper that you need minions or weapons to ping it off  Consecrate doesnt do jack shit anymore  it always comes down 1 turn to late or doesnt do enough damage for what it costs and I would happily remove the 2 face damage for more minion damage or a mana cost reduction  and then it would be outclassed by Lightning Storm  When you sit through a game like I just did with two Equalities in your hand and everything you play getting removed by Blackwing Corruptor Pings  SWPain  Potion of Madness  and have two Equalities in your hand  you realize just how horrible this card is on its own and how unreliable it fucking is as AoE  despite the arguments of reddit who tries to turn a blind eye and points at Rogue  who has single target removal of the kind Paladins can only dream of  Hunter  who has a lot more overstatted earlymid game minions to snowball unfortunately Pirates killed it  or Druid  who can ramp out big threats and has way more midlate game options than Paladin does  all of them have an upside despite not having AoE  what the fuck is Paladins upside in this meta besides healing face with doesnt even change anything They are mediocre at everything and just fucking lose every game unless the opponent draws badly  thats our win condition  Blizzard thinks its fine and releases no cards to replace Uldaman except a bulky 6 cost legendary despite the fact that every time a minion with more than 6 health comes down on the board if you play Paladin you start to seriously consider whether you need to break out Equality or not  and your only answer for Ysera outside of Keeper is fucking Equality  Blizzard hasnt given Paladins any AoE options in the last Standard set except a fucking 6 mana murloc that might as well have Consecrate attached to it because after turn 6 its a miracle if you get a minion to stick on the board  and a ripoff Brawl that always guarantees their biggest minion wins it that doesnt even work for Paladins because Paladins single target removal is a joke while Warriors have Execute Shield Slam Gorehowl  And Im just fucking sick  FUCKING SICK DO YOU HEAR ME BLIZZARD of the stream of understatted early game minions that Blizzard keep giving Paladins  like the fucking 2 mana 22 that does jack shit or the 4 mana 34 that you wont ever get to play except with a meme 5 drop card  or a 1 drop which dilutes your deck strength and outside of a little synergy with some understatted cards is a statline that doesnt even see play  it was fucking worse when I heard that chump designer call the 1 mana card a flexible and powerful card when its exactly the opposite  they released Sunkeeper Tarim who doesnt even fucking combo with Consecrate as a 10 mana board clear and needs stuff to be on the board to clear shit  SO WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY KEEP RELEASING MINIONS THAT WONT STICK  Do any of them even fucking play Paladin except for the 1 or 2 hours it seems they play it just to check the mechanic works without bugs 3  Hydrologist pisses me off because its a Murloc and doesnt look anything like a Paladin  you could hide the border and everyone would think its a fucking neutral card and would only guess Paladin from looking at the text because Paladins are the only ones who get Secrets and Murlocs  none of which fit the fantaasy of being a Paladin with armour  They release shit cards like Vilefin Inquisitor as the class 1 drop that it feels like half of Hearthstone has right now and it has 0 synergy unless you play a fucking Murloc deck  and then they release like a hundred board clears for everyone else so that they can clear the board if Paladin ever decides to play Murlocs  Look at fucking Tunnel Trogg or Mana Wyrm or Malchezars Imp  their 1 drops are much less conditional and dont change your hero power into what looks like fishes playing dress up so why the fuck do we get murlocs every fucking expansion What the fuck do murlocs have to do with Paladins at all Every single expansion they release a Murloc card  and even if its a good card like Anyfin is Possible it pisses me the fuck off that theyre wasting their time designing a murloc  4  Why the fuck are Shamans and Paladins the only class along with Druids who can tank  dps and heal in WoW and Shamans in HS receive great midrange minions great early game minions single target removal burst damage healing AoE viable early weapons and late game in the form of Jades and Paladins every expansion get a bunch of disjointed cards  a heal card and a murloc card and provide 0 support for all the other things we need to be a successful class  FUCK YOU BLIZZARD  I dont even want all of the things Shamans got but by golly if youre going to make us into a late game class fucking give us card draw  give us late game minions that arent legendaries  give us removal  give us AoE  either that or give us earlymid game  right now you just have to try building a deck with it to beat Pirate Warrior and you realize youre putting in like 80 neutral minions before t4 because theyre better and it doesnt even work  I even put in Goldshire Footman because its more relevant than the joke one drop you released for us in Gadgetzan whos a 12 if you dont get him buffed  like why are all the cards fucking reliant on another card  so if you dont get the condition they are fucking terrible WHY The damned 21 just gets removed turn 1 by fucking NZoths First Mate pings before you can even do anything and then you just play stuff every turn to see if it sticks and die on t5 because you hero power t2 hero power t3 AND IVE HAD FUCKING ENOUGH BLIZZARD ENOUGH WITH YOUR BULLSHIT
