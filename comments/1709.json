money andor who are more involved with blizzard and its games  Come on you dont really think that massive losing streaks are supposed to occur on a regular basis  I S information systems run evrything nowadays  You wouldnt trust a sketchy website that hosts poker tournaments  but why then would we trust a business that wants easy money by hosting a card game  Anyways long rant short its Not luck its just manipulation\", \"commentId\": \"35859\", \"commentDate\": \"1492893153\"}, {\"comment\": \"Yeah  must be why Kripps widely regarded as the luckiest player  huh\", \"commentId\": \"35860\",
