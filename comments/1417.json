these are the main things that annoy me about Hearthstone  and consequently cause the most salt  People playing decks that they shouldnt be playing where they are Top tier decks in casual  standard

2nd one Aggro  The only aggro deck I never really minded was aggro freeze mage because it was the only aggro deck that required the slightest bit of skill Best for last RNG  Mainly when you notice

beginner decks  The only decks I play now are Beast Jade DruidHeal Jade Shaman and EvolveDevolve Jade Shaman  IMO Casual is just a place for players who dont enjoy or want to bother with Ranked  There probably should be one more mode that allows you to do quests but which doesnt earn you any gold  Its kind of punishing for people who really want to face original decks though\", \"commentId\":
