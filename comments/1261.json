"[{\"comment\": \"Sure bro CotW is almost certainly the best card in Standard  Why would you not build your entire deck around getting a charge 4 atk AND taunt AND buff  If CotW were neutral  I would put it in EVERY SINGLE deck I built  including priest  because   why not take over pretty much any board state as early as turn 7 Theres nothing fun about getting burned down to 15 by any competent hunter by turn 67  and them STILL having the better endgame\", \"commentId\": \"26453\", \"commentDate\": \"1475121653\"}, {\"comment\": \"why is it that when running a combo deck  the combo is the

flamewalker Like fine Tuskar needed a nerf but its going to go since its part of the grand tournament set  Flamewalker is going out as well since its part of the BRM set  The amount of damageswing it can do on turn 5 is stupidly insane  I had to deal with ten dmg to my face from some of the most shitty spells  In addition  yes the charge spell was way too op  Nerfing that was right but I think they completely killed it  A minion would not only get charge but 2 extra dmg  which could be the final decider of a match  Nerfing it so a minion cant hit the hero I just dont know  I feel like they could have nerfed it in some other way like removing the extra dmg or something  Blizzard really dont like combo decks which rely on thinking do they I mean whilst I get a lil annoyed by warrior otk and rogue mill decks  at least them decks make you think constantly  Instead  we got a meta with braindeadboring decks  The decks I hate the most  Cthun decks  Just wait till turn ten   yep that is predictable  boring and lame  I find it funny as well that there was absolutely no mention of the 4 mana 77  And finally Yogg  Too much rng even if it gets sliencedremoved  I guess its fine imo since the games where I had to played against it  it would normally either have little effect or let me win the game  Still though  it did annoy me when it totally swings the board and it makes me think why do you need the rest of the cards in your deck when you only really rely on Yogg lol  Semisalt post  Sort of happy Blizzard made these changes but didnt really think about several other cards people
