Brewmaster  Gadgetzan Ferryman and Ancient Brewmaster  Right now only 6 are used  if it would require 5 minions by current standard you would need 56 activators to activate the quest which in some cases can mean nearly you entire deck  Ofcourse with adding Ancient Brewmaster that would be much easier  but considering how slow that card is  quest rogue would be dead in an instant  Simply because Miracle Rogue As it always was is beyond broken deck and he would step in as main rogue deck  Balancing this card is challenging  Right now its overpowered but even what seems a slight nerf would make it a dead card\", \"commentId\": \"36730\", \"commentDate\": \"1494099069\"}, {\"comment\": \"Fucking HAD IT with this goddamned rigged fixed game mulliganing 4 and 5 cost cards and getting worse back
