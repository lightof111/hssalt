that Hearthstone is a pure strategy game  There are no games that are as popular as Hearthstone that have more or even close to the amount of RNG Hearthstone has     The muligan is RNG  every draw is

\"So  Ive had to stop playing Priest I know  you are welcome xD  It was just brutal  I didnt know how brutal it was until I started tracking my games  Ive tried to play from the computer and not too much from my tablet  And I have been able to  It sucks  because Priest is my favorite class  probably because I hate ZooLock with a passion    However when I looked at the stats  it was very revealing to see why players that normally rank higher track their games  With Priest I am 2541  thats an abysmal winning percentage of 37 9  Or if you want to be positive  thats a losing percentage of 62 1 However  the rest of the decks did mostly better but I was able to see the play by play as well  And it just baffles me how much luck is involved in winning and losing games  Very few games were decided on misplays from my or the opponent  And it was basically decided on the card draw  My game sample is 232 games  for those that like to criticize small samples  Having said that  those that like to vent too much need to realize that some people are luckier than others  And you are in the last group  just like I am  So do yourself a favor and dont rage that much  accept that this is a flip of the coin and just get on with it    Life is too short to get so angry  Instead  try to look for things where you can improve the game and suggest those changes  Good Luck XD\", \"commentId\":

\"The matchmaking is definitely rigged based on my testing  Ben Brode appears to simply be lying when he says match ups are determined solely on rank and not on deck content  I played 42 consecutive games with an offmeta control priest not using current expansion cards designed to wreck Shaman  and faced a high proportion of control decks warrior  Druid  priest etc often running Cthun ranks 1816  I then switched to a midrange Shaman  played 42 more in the same rank range  and the proportion of Cthun and control decks dropped and the proportion of midrange decks suddenly jumped dramatically  Using confidence intervals for proportions I can state that the difference in proportions faced by the two deck types was statistically significant with 95 confidence  In other words there is less than a 5 chance 1 in 20 that simple bad luck explains the change  Now  this is not a bulletproof test  but I do have a postgraduate degre in Statistics and this does seem to suggest match ups are rigged based on your deck type  My theory is the matchmaking is designed to create match ups that convince people to play the current expansion cards that blizzard wants to sell   No tinfoil hat required  just some data and a little math\", \"commentId\": \"22760\", \"commentDate\": \"1468560669\"}, {\"comment\": \"Just a reminder that whatever rank you achieve playing Shaman in this meta is

I am always rather suspicious about anything especially freetoplay games that wants to get my money  This is why I dont feel its necessary to take the competition aspect of this game very seriously  which I feel that if more players ever came to the same conclusion as me  Blizzard will have ruined their own game    Still  given the fact that game developers are well aware of the addictive nature of certain games and design styles  I have no doubts they havent done their homework and understand that the likelihood of everyone just shrugging their shoulders and playing for fun is next to nothing   And to stay on topic    MAN THAT REALLY PISSES ME OFF WAAAAH\", \"commentId\": \"22762\", \"commentDate\": \"1468561472\"}, {\"comment\": \"You understand that 5 isnt that small You have a

uncultured  cross reference Gilbert and SullivanSeriously though  I know what you and the other smug people  as I called the group are referring to and in some ways you are  of course  correct  But take it from someone who has some experience about 20 years  all told with teaching  learning  thinking and the related psychology you are also very wrong That advice is simply not correct  and outright dangerous  until you have reached a certain point in your understanding  Before that it is just as likely to destroy you as help you learn  The reason is that without a correct foundation of understanding you do not know what you are supposed to watch for  what you need to know about the cards or what is a solid deck  But you will still make connections  without any guarantee they are relevant or correct Due to this fact  you are actually more likely to entrench faulty understanding and become a worse player over time if there is no one to actively correct your faulty thinking  All selflearning is by association and pattern study  but our brains cannot recognize its own faulty thinking  Since there are more way to be wrong than to be right\", \"commentId\": \"22766\",
