because having fun is discouraged   Second game  I had a back and forth with some unusual Druid deck  I cleared his board  and he played a Stranglethorn Tiger  I saw this as a good opportunity to play Reno  so I pulled myself back up to 30  With 10 mana  he played Raven Idol  got Alexstrasza  and hit me with the Tiger to set me to 10 Health  I cleared what I could  but he played double Savage Roar and killed me   Last game  I ran into hyper aggressive DragonPirate Warrior  Reno never came out of the deck  and I had 2 health left  I thought I just maybe had a chance because he didnt have a weapon  there were no minions on board  and his hand was empty  With 8 mana  I Renounced into Paladin and got Lay on Hands  which costed exactly 1 more mana than I could afford to play  He top decked Mortal Strike  and I quit playing\", \"commentId\": \"21868\", \"commentDate\": \"1466570211\"}, {\"comment\": \"Youll be back n you know it\", \"commentId\": \"21869\", \"commentDate\":
