salty right now at the lack of fanservicey card art in the what weve seen from the new expansion so far  Seems like each card expansion we get the art gets more inclusive and less sexy  I better see

just finish the quests  and i dont bother to try and climb the ladder and arena is a complete mess     but when the new expansion comes i am sure  that there will be broken op decks that blizzard thought will be fun and they did not know players will use to do huge face damage or otk with and they will dominate the so called meta for a couple of months until new broken decks come in the next expansion     just a stupid musical chairs game between classes to see who will be in 50 of ladder games    sorry for the long rant but i really like the game  but now when i play  i just feel

depressing when Im playing a control deck that I fail to draw any board clears against aggrozoomidrange opponents who completely play into them  and then when I switch to a zoomidrange deck I dont

disappointed  Recently I was playing in Casual with some garbage deck made for quests when I came across another player who was obviously doing the same  I caught on and just let him play his cards out  and he did the same  After the match I sent a friend request  he accepted  and we thanked each other for being cool and helping out  Ive been trying to do the stupid 75 Murloc quest for a bit now  just playing murlocs and not attacking  hoping my opponent will catch on and let me play them out  Of course none have and instead go face like its going out of style  Im not saying that if you see a person who is obviously doing quests that you simply let them play out their cards  I dont expect that at all  but it would definitely be appreciated if it happened more often\", \"commentId\":
