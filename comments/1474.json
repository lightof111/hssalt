"[{\"comment\": \"This just in  this game is 100 draw luck an thats it  Its a fact and no amount of bull shit excuses of why it isnt wont change that fact   The same fucktards getting legend doesnt prove a god damned thing either   They just play cancer decks and draw luckier   Its really that simple   Every fucking game is decided now by turn 4 or 5 at the latest   Even with ass cunt Reno decks     once you know they are playing that asshole cunt card its easier to just concede   Of course  the buttpirate asshole Warrior deck is an auto concede since they have like 5 minions on the board and a buffed weapon by turn 3   Un fucking believable   This game is not going to last unless they ad  some skill and remove all of the draw luck   Go ahead  explain to me why its NOT all luck   You cant   You have no proof   Dateless  nerdy teenagers who jerk off to anime getting legend doesnt make the game require skill so dont go there  Thanks\", \"commentId\": \"30926\", \"commentDate\":

\"I fucking hate Reno Jackson  Stupidest damn card in the game  Let see  my deck sucks donkey balls  but Im okay because I have fucking Reno by turn 6   Or better yet the game takes 20 fucking minutes

again  I suppose I should have learned at the stage we suffered through grim patron warrior  secret paladin  and face shaman metas  I just met pirate warrior pirate warrior and pirate fucking Hunter  Ive even seen a pirate Druid which makes no sense to me as they dont run weapons  I fucking hate blizzard for ruining this game by releasing unbalanced cards that lead to overpowered decks and then not nerfing them quickly enough  I hate all the wankers riding the cancer wagon just as much  have some fucking self respect\", \"commentId\": \"30929\", \"commentDate\": \"1484278112\"},

burst armor is fine  Against aggro without burst armor up maybe a mistake  Against midrange armor up  it depends if you have the board  Against control armor up is almost always irrelevant and at worst a missplay   Armoring up when you are already at 12hp is always correct if you have extra mana  By the time you are turn 78 if you can safely push your self around 10hp being able to activate the 4 mana 6 damages may win you the game\", \"commentId\": \"30935\", \"commentDate\": \"1484299706\"}, {\"comment\": \"Of course there is skill in this game since the same players reach legend all

are more interactive than that  aslo i want to share another story  this time about RNG mirror match controlwarrior my opponent already played his monkey  i play a Dirty Rat and pull a Deathwing  alright i have full life  50 armor  no big deal yet but its a threat so i play Sylvanas Windrunner  my opponent gets a Bane of Doom and from that a Blood Imp but cant kill my sylvanas  so i smash the queen into the deathwing and win the 50 chance of getting the deathwing  after that my opponent couldnt come back  so a pure CONTROLgame was won by RNG  just wanted to say that \", \"commentId\":

with the delusion that you can win with fun interesting cards  i guess because i refuse to play brainless aggro netdecks i will forever be punished and playing the middle ranks   punishment for
