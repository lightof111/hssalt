opponent has an answer to your board state or a single minion you played  You think you play without mistakes but perhaps you rush things more than should etc   Personally I climbed perfectly well with a control paladin deck where I teched some cards depending on my matchups  Its strong against most aggro decks  mages and can outvalue taunt warrior and even quest rogue even though it can be tough   Best of luck dude\", \"commentId\": \"36863\", \"commentDate\": \"1494239645\"}, {\"comment\": \"Thanks mate  I am sticking to Giant quest mage  the stupid burn mage at the moment not swapping anymore  But to top the salt of the day I face the first quest rogue of the day  three times after each other  But gonna quit today for sure   Its not a good day to play HS apparently  Also can confirm its not the decks  I just incredibly suck at HS today since I managed to drop from rank 113 stars to 143 stars\", \"commentId\": \"36864\", \"commentDate\": \"1494240276\"}, {\"comment\": \"I believe Frozen said on the winter championship that Hearthstone is a psichological game    I wondered a lot what he meant by that  and since then I always try to focus and remind myself of the fact  that you can only play good when you are calm and think through every move you make  Rank in HS reflects also how many games you play  and you just cannot play a lot with rage like yours  therefore it is making your rank worse   In spite of this  yesterday my first match with my silence priest against control pally  could not find inner fire with shadow visions  last 6 cards 2 wins the game  last 4 still 2 wins the game  but no  cannot draw that  Tilting the first match made my daily winrate 36 and I have not moved a single star forward   TLDR I know it is really hard to stay calm  but imho that is a huge part of succes  so just put some zen music on or whatever makes you calm and grind that ladder to eventual succes\", \"commentId\": \"36865\", \"commentDate\": \"1494242747\"}, {\"comment\":

There is literally nothing as discouraging as slowly having to watch as you degrade further and further game after game  Because somehow I manage to pull off a winrate of 20 or something  I feel like the worst HS player ever  And also somehow feel the need to keep complaining about it here  I did not even concede here  I just quit  Im just gonna quit HS for today  Who knows forever if this goes on  If I cant even make it to rank 10 each month  Then this game feels so meaningless and punishing  If I play tomorrow  I am certain Ill end up at rank 15  Regardless of the decks I play\",
