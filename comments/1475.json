broken and we have to suffer while Blizzard are still selling packs from the new expansion  Soon as the income stream drops because everyone who is going to spend money on the new expansion cards to adapt to the meta has bought them  Blizzard will announce nerfs to pirate and possibly some of the Jadeeffect cards  In the meantime get used to frustrating games or ride the broken the cancer decks to the top  Must be shameful to be a long time player with skill and have to resort to playing the generic pirate deck to ladder\", \"commentId\": \"30974\", \"commentDate\": \"1484346410\"}]"
