actually a deck left that is viable AND fun   Im sitting on fucking rank 10 for 1 week now   Either its braindead bastard Druid with their 1010s for 1 mana or dumbass Pirate Warrior  Seriously  this

still play this pile of shit game\", \"commentId\": \"33665\", \"commentDate\": \"1489484863\"}, {\"comment\": \"I consider Jade Shaman as the strongest deck at present   Heal  AoE strong mid and lategame  Climbing was not difficult  But its also an often encountered meta deck  Maybe you will not consider it fun as well  But if you meet a lot of pirate warriors  Beast Druid seems to have a good matchup with them  I lost only 1 time with a very poor draw against a good draw on the pirates side  The rest of appr  1015 games I won admitted it is not a very big sample size  As a beast druid you have the better early game minions in particluar if you innervate out a 3 drop and can kill all his pirates which will deny him the Trigger of Bloodsail Cultist   An ideal start can look like Innervate  Druid of the Flame and turn 2 Mark of YShaarj   That gives you carddraw and a 47 on turn 2    It is no Problem to leave your minions at 1 health  because pirates do not run AoE of any Kind  so you can always do the greedy trade which Forces him to use his weapons on your minions  And in the midgame  you have the stronger minions with Stranglethorn Tiger   Druid of the Claw   Virmen Sensei enables many good trades and Menagerie Warden   From turn 4 on  the damage from beast druid quickly adds up  Plus the possible burst damage from Savage Roar  Obviously  beast druid is also good against Jade Druid  because it is a very fast deck  Unless Jade Druid draws the nuts  it will be quick over in the beast druids favour  BUT  beast druid is bad against shaman and Reno mage  Too much removal on their side  Thats why I changed decks as soon as the number of pirates decreased\", \"commentId\": \"33666\", \"commentDate\": \"1489486034\"}, {\"comment\": \"I guess I should have

passed rank 15 Id previously done so but fell in rank before hitting 10 Ive either got to stoop to peoples levels and join the meta using either my Jade Druid who lacks Aya or my Pirate Warrior which is outdated and is still running STB and because I lack major threats such as Leeroy  Thing is  I dont really want to play either of these decks  I like them  and yeah they were the only two I could make when I opened my packs I preordered since the game gave me Patches as my legendary and that was it  Theres just so much of it in ladder right now that I really dont want to think about touching it  Im not having fun and I play HS to relax from school  Enter my dilemma  Its a College Snow Day I know So rare for College kids to get the day off because even if it snows and its a mess  if theres some shred you can make it to class youre required to go and I really want to catch up on some much needed Hearthstone games  My problem being that if I want any hope of climbing ladder Im limited to three decks  Pirate Warrior  Jade Druid or Dragon Priest  Neither of these I particularly want to play since theyre so stale and literally everyone and their brothers brother is playing them  I own other decks mostly gimmick decks I made for fun but they dont really stand a good chance in the meta and at most will either go 5050 winlose or just straight up get out valued because the current decks either rack too big or straight up are so aggressive that I cant counter fast enough due to mine being too slow  Hunter is my favorite class and my first class I reached level 60 with as well as earning gold with it and Im leaning on wanting to play it again but with the way Standard is  Hunter is pretty much nonexistent   What do I doDo I stoop to that level of shallow and be one of those Jade Druid  Pirate Warrior  Dragon Priest pricks who only cares about destroying their opponent and ranking up and start trying to grind frivolously to climb ladder Or do I play something fun and hope that I go against other decks aside from the current meta and aim for a good  long game that both players feel like theyre playing and actively doing things rather than one being chewed into the ground I used to own Leeroy but I disenchanted him and a few others for Yogg when he was big    a week before Yogg got nerfed and lost a lot of dust and 3 legendaries  Shouldnt have done that but stupid me wanted a fun  random card to play with and got bit in the butt pretty hard after  Do note that I was not aware that Yogg was being nerfed until about a day or so after Id made him  theyd announced it\", \"commentId\": \"33669\", \"commentDate\": \"1489494352\"}, {\"comment\": \"I hope every pirate warrior dies slowly Wild casual  playing nzoth priest  dropped 2 deathlords  1

that just click face like robots  I even find it a bit sad because those are usually super bad players or kids that wanna win a bit  and some idiotic designer in Blizzard made it possible and effective  Anyways  sometimes I meet FacePirate inferiors that genuinely play it  not even for golden portait  cos they already have one that rope every turn like this example here       So  even tho I win and I feed off inferiors with Pirate Warrior   they give me free wins  I am still not happy with that brainless game and this entity that roped me from turn 1 to his loss killed inside me last drop of humanity   From this moment on  I will rope and BM every single Pirate Warrior  literally from turn 1 to the moment I win well 73 5 of the matches I win  it sometimes happen that I manage to lose due to immensely bad draw but shit happens  I will torture them  farm them  make them triggered  waste their time while I watch a movie or something  I dont give a fuck if I am now worse than

doing any dmg to myself  Its the opposite  I make myself happier knowing that my opponent Pirate Warrior in particular might get triggered  It will give me joy and fun in HS that Ive been searching
