\"So you know how Warrior always has Fiery Win Axe on turn 2 I decided to try out control warrior for the first time and guess who only got his axes at the end of the game multiple times and only once had it ready on turn 2 ME So yeah  a deck that people can pilot to legend  gets me stuck on rank 18  Im sure Im not playing it right either  but Im at the moment sick and tired of seeing resurrect priests  They dont win  they just annoy you into giving up\", \"commentId\": \"26801\", \"commentDate\": \"1475958082\"}, {\"comment\": \" Looks at decklist Looks at Wallet Cries\", \"commentId\":

i get his side of the board FULL without playing a single minion ON ARENA  Is that not enough  He had 2 flamestrikes\", \"commentId\": \"26803\", \"commentDate\": \"1475960028\"}, {\"comment\": \"So I was so fucking sick of facing shamans that I queued a couple of games with freeze mage  Dont judge me I HATE freeze mage  Its an uninteractive cancerdeck  but I hate shamans even more  So in about two hours of games I met a couple of other freeze mages  and I was actually shocked by how disgustingly bad most of them were  They seemed like they had not a single fucking clue how to do basic math  play around cards like alex  properly pop blocks etc   I met 5 other freeze mages and beat them all  even though I had a crappier hand in most of the matches and Im not even a godlike freeze mage myself   Ive said it before and Ill say it again I hate freeze mage  its an uninteractive deck played by people who think theyre smart for doing preschool math\", \"commentId\": \"26804\",

the murlocs  So I said Well played I was pretty sure that the only way I could lose is if I get a disconnect    And it happened   when I had my win conditions on board and my opponent had Doomsayer    Seriously  that was the only possible way I could lose that match    and my opponent didnt gave up after burning 2 Anyfins  WTF Yeah  Im salty  Yugioh the abridged series is highly recommended  its

himself or pops himself back into my hand  or otherwise accomplishes very little  Though to be fair  thats usually what he did for my opponent when he was played against me  There have been some instances where he made things a little better for either of us  depending on who plays him  but I do remember one match where my opponent outright died to his own Yogg   Anyway  hope you enjoyed this
