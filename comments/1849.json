seems to happen often  when I tech for something specific I see a dramatic drop in those I am teching  against  I did a little experiment and teched in 1 of each crab and an eater of secrets  I was

very odd and hard to imagine it is all coincidence\", \"commentId\": \"38755\", \"commentDate\": \"1497645397\"}, {\"comment\": \"I dont know what happened to ladder on NA  Ive fallen from Rank 11 4 stars to Rank 14 in the last day  and the ladder Im seeing is no way representative of any stats Ive seen online  I feel Im seeing all Mage and Priests  The problema good thing for them is that it is nearly impossible to know which style of MagePriest they are until well into the battle  No Im not playing Pirate Warrior  Ive played some miracle rogue  some control paladin and some midrange paladin  I got frustrated and played one game of Crystal Rogue  won  but felt dirty doing so  I guess I just suck at ladder right now or pick the wrong deck  Like literally i can do no right  I lost to a NZoth Hunter with Dragon priest  Who plays Nzoth Hunter It is like people can see my hand\", \"commentId\": \"38756\", \"commentDate\": \"1497649430\"}, {\"comment\": \"This weeks tavern brawl   8
