even at their best have 55 win rate and complain that you cant hit legend with them  Rank 5 seems about right  and yeah  Patches is that good  Also  Reno decks need all the budget you can squeeze

card to have  Its stuff like Leeroy that needs to go  or maybe just Charge in general should be changed to where it cant attack players  That would require a pretty big overhaul I suppose but it would finally put an end to a lot of the burst potential in the game Even stuff like just southsea deckhand  cold blood  x2  Thats 10 damage  plus hero power  plus spells  Anything with Charge makes all cheap buffs dangerous in hearthstone and its just not fun to play against it  As a control deck you can almost never stabilize against anything anymore  except the very aggroiest of decks that somehow fail to curvestone you\", \"commentId\": \"30598\", \"commentDate\": \"1483720187\"}, {\"comment\": \"Havent played since earlymid of last season and Im really feeling refreshed  Until I queue into

against rogue he ofcourse gets turn 1 buccaneer then at turn 3 he gets 1010 edwin i top deck my only mulch and at that point i am pretty sure that i have won the game but no turn 5 i play fandral he prep evicerate weapon to kill my fandral then he plays the 1drop from mulchone that gives health at the end of turn AND play tomb pillager then from the rest of the game everything is only face while i try to control board after i manage to clean his shit he play questing  stealth at that point i am at 6 hp drawn half of my deck 0 armor or taunt    games like this make me want to uninstall

level up  now mostly dragon rogue for shit and giggles  but nope  Every other match is against a pirate warrior and ends by the turn 5 or 6  I dont want to tech my FUN deck just to counter it  simply because I would have to cut a lot of dragonrelated cards and honestly there is still little chance that I will stop that clown fiesta  Instead I instaconcede whenever I see first mate  patches  try not to get salty and move on    but its hard and Im close to the point of giving the game up for some time  Honestly  Ive found face hunter meta  and even facemidrange shaman  less annoying than this

Hearthstone if not for the win  after your Mulch Topdeck  The reason for this is that you basically go all in to create a 1010 Edwin on those earlie turns  giving up all your cards  To topdeck Mulch  which lets be honest was your only option to stay alive in this game  so basically was the only card that would have saved you out of all the other cards you could have drawn  is very lucky Given those circumanstances you should look at this game like this and realize that you were actually the one that was lucky that game\", \"commentId\": \"30609\", \"commentDate\": \"1483740500\"},
