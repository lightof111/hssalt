insane cards  Or release insane sht  because this isnt just for TCGs  because people will use them  Yeah  believe it or not  there is a thing such as proper game designing  and it doesnt involve what

for doing so to be honest  However in broader  archetypal terms the community  not you and me perhaps  but the wider community   has tacitly accepted the overall type of balance blizzard have wanted to give us  Im not talking so much about  broken cards as the general tempo oriented nature of the game whereby cheaper cards have more value  This is a tempo and aggro game and a lot of people have bought into it not through card choice but deck choice\", \"commentId\": \"26963\", \"commentDate\": \"1476374066\"}, {\"comment\": \"Atleast you are lucky enough to get some legendaries I opened too

he has 2 11s    I was salty but managed to get back into the game again so it was fine but then I  got Flamestroke and Blizzarded and he proceeded to kill me with the same stupid Torch he got from the book     I wonder why I still play MagestoneHeores of Spellcraft    I obviously dont like losing especially cause of RNG but Id feel better if he didnt misplay all the time     Here Im just gonna
