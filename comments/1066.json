say some things about hitting legend   Its not hard  but it takes motivation  dedication  and  to a lesser extent  a good netdeck  Why I lack those and thus have never reached legend in 2 years Rank 3

miracle rogue  aggro whatever  zoo  they all make me vomit  I have a good collection  and Im sure if I pick a wellpolished battletested deck  Ill hit that  Instead I prefer to constantly improve my own deckbuilding skills  Dedication I have a job  a wife  and besides  there are other video games too   Motivation if hitting legend was more rewarding  Id definitely go for it  Bragging rights and a card back  well for me its just not enough  Im pretty sure Im not the only one  And we arent dumber than monkeys\", \"commentId\": \"22252\", \"commentDate\": \"1467447432\"}, {\"comment\": \"Really
