Emperor Thaurissan dropped a Confessor Paletress and summoned another random legendary   I dropped Brawl broken freaking card  Thaurissan lived  and I executed him   At this point I have a 56 Gurubashi Berserker and a 22 slime and Grommash Hellscream and Inner Rage in my hand   I hit him for face   I have everything I need for lethal next turn   What does he do  Drops Onyx Bishop   What does it fing res out of the 10 minions Ive destroyed Confessor Paletress   What does she fing summon Bolf Ramshield   Literally the one freaking card that could save the game for him   I was so pissed its not even funny   This is quite litterally the story of like 50 of my hearthstone games   Im winning and then lose to sht like this   I dont mind Yogg and burgle rogues because thats a deck built to create so much RNG you get a favorable outcome   Its this BS 1 time RNG luck crap thats beyond infuriating\", \"commentId\": \"27226\", \"commentDate\": \"1477180146\"}, {\"comment\": \"I am sorry for the length of this post but there is a lot of stored up salt I have to unleash right now So  I know everyone hates Shaman and so do I  but there are things I hate more  This is the complete list of the decks I am facing on ladder right now  First of all  I consider myself an alright player and I decided to grind legend this season  It went well in the beginning  climbing to rank 1 in not too many games  But then something went wrong and I dropped to rank 4  not being able to progress since then  I am playing tempo mage  So  the decks I am facing and why I hate most of them in no particular order Shaman The obvious one while my winrate against shaman is positive and tempo mage works fine against it  the amount of times you play against it and the riddiculessness that occurs when the shaman draws his perfect curve makes it just frustrating  Druid I loose a lot against them  they always seem to draw Malygos on the turn before I would have lethal  If I have my early game in the beginning they have all the removals and if I have my late game in the starting hand  they have all the ramp  Also 0 mana 88s should not be a thing  seriously  they nerfed molten giant but put that card in the game    Hunter Secret Hunters have a tough time against a tempo mage  since I dont need to activate most of their secrets and can pretty consistently just kill them with my flamewaker  ragnaros and a lot of spells  It sure would be great if there were more hunters than one in every 15 matches I never thought I would say that Discard Zoo Again  being a tempo deck I can win most of the times against them  unless they discard the silverware golem when killing my flamewaker with their soulfire which happens all the time    Renolock I put pressure on the board  bring them low  they reno but I still have the board  It should be easy from there on     At least you would think that  At that moment they play twisting nether  you topdeck a manawyrm or some other useless card  they play Jaraxxus and win the game because all the burst is at the bottom of my deck  Mage The only mage deck I have encountered recently is freeze mage  They dont stand a chance since freezing my minions doesnt stop me from killing them with Facewaker  If I draw somewhat decently I trigger their block by turn 8 and there is nothing they can do  No salt there  I always liked freezemage  Priest Now I realize priest is a joke among the community  but it is also a hard counter to tempo mage  I despise priest because while they are obviously a very weak class  they are simply annoying  I want them to be nerfed out of existence  even more than they already are  Priest should have no right to exist  Their cards lack power but sometimes they can be combined in such a way that the opponent can do nothing  Priest either fails horribly at doing anything or they chain their shit and prevent you from ever getting board control back  I honestly believe that priest is the most horribly designed class of them all  Warrior The worst of them all  I hate them more than shaman or any other class  The Facewarrior is annyoing because it is always just a face race that I oftentimes cant win  All the charge and weapons makes board control meaningless  But way worse than that is Control Warrior  Of course  being a mage  it is my arch nemesis  But I am no freeze mage  I dont rely on a one or two turn kill  I can put pressure on the board and deal consistent high damage plus burst  At least in theory  In practice  no matter what you do  they just outarmor you and remove every single thing you put on the board  I play around brawl and revenge and all that stuff but it is just impossible to escape the bashs and weapons and executes as if the nerf did anything and shield slams  Being agressive early results in them killing your shit with removal and then armoring up so you cant finish them waiting for a great combo means they have stacked tons of armor and your 4 fireballs from Antonidas are not enough  Their mission is to make you complete the deal 100 damage to enemy heroes quest in a single game  I started conceding once I hear Welcome to the Grand Tournament Champion unless I have a clear advantage winning from then on is just impossible  Justicar is the one card I am most exited about rotating out  By the way  I dont know if I am supposed to laugh or cry about

worst classes  but in reality theyre almost as broken as Shamanstone  Seriously  Whenever they play like some sort of good minion thats so vulnerable to dying Divine Spirit Inner Fire  Like  wtf And
