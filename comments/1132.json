son comes upstairs to me  where Im generally ignoring him because he seems a bit like a spoiled brat  After he leaves the room  I go to get a snack from downstairs  and when I come back to my room Ive gone from Rank 10 and streaking to Rank 12 no stars because the brat is autoconceding my games and laughing  I kick the kid out  but not before he pounds my mouse and ends turn prematurely when I had lethal my opponent then had lethal as well  After my dads friend and his kid left mercifully  I queued into a game against zoo  I get him down to 1 health  then clear board with Deathwing  The Zoo has no cards in hand and cant tap  So naturally he topdecks    Siphon Soul And thats how I went from being 152 on the season to 1514 in about a half hour  Luckily  I won two games from there to put myself in the exact position I was at the start of the day rank 13 and streaking  so I deleted the corrupted data and reset myself to 60 on the season in my spreadsheets\", \"commentId\": \"23652\",
