Today I was playing CWarrior against a shaman obviously and he had Spirit Claws equipped but nothing on his side of the field  I played Acolyte of Pain and what does the shaman do He plays Barnes So I am super happy thinking to myself Cool  I am going to kill the 11 with my Acolyte and get at least 2 draws from it  But wait  which minions comes down from Barnes Thalnos Its already annoying having to deal with shamans all the time but when they get crazy RNG on their side like this it just makes the game super frustrating\", \"commentId\": \"27482\", \"commentDate\": \"1477914820\"},
