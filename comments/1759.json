its cancer pirate warrior is most effective at climbing this season  but keep in mind I do not have Leeroy Jenkins and dont have the buff pirates but I could disenchant some cards for the epic pirate

perfect   The game does not match you against bad matchups because you arent a pro  and does not have a rigged algorithm to give you bad draws and bad mulligans   Many times you are in fact lucky as well   It is a little sad you truly believe the game is rigged though  thats some Enemy of The State level shit right there   Most cases you just play super greedy decks with greedy plays and lose because of such   At least in the games Ive watched   Id say let someone spectate and talk over each play with them  rather than get mad when a certain player may offer advice on why one play could be better than the one you just made \", \"commentId\": \"36902\", \"commentDate\": \"1494277526\"}, {\"comment\": \"Nah  thats just your bad luck man  I main rogue usually miracle  but sometimes I play thief rogue for fun and whenever I see a freeze mage on the ladder I want to go jump off a bridge  With so few threats in miracle although I do admit the recent additions of sherazin and arcane giants in miracle rogue help relieve this problem a little bit and no heals aside from mistress of mixtures which I dont even run  I can confidently say that even with ice block losing is all but inevitable  All mage has to do is chuck all their spells at rogues face and you just cant do anything about that  So yea  Go complain to someone else about your issue of not being able to kill a rogue because they steal a single decent card that  I might add  your deck is notorious for running two of plus the certain draw of both  of them via Arcanologist  Its not like they had a chance of winning
