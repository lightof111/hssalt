"[{\"comment\": \"To people still playing pirate warrior  please take your head out of your arse for 1 second and notice there is a new expansion  I hope you can activate your singular braincell for once and have the balls to come up with something new  But no sure  you just keep playing your pathetic deck you sickening fuck  What the fuck is up with zoolocks as well  The oldschool ones  everywhere ppl play them  And every deck is exactly the same and kills me by turn 4  How great is it to netdeck eh everyone How nice huh  great game hearthstone  Day two of a new expansion and I already fucking hate it\", \"commentId\": \"34922\", \"commentDate\": \"1491689984\"}, {\"comment\": \"Played against an Exodia Mage  Wow  One of the dumbest games Ive ever played  Had a resounding lead for the first 6 or 7 turns  and was getting close to lethal  Next five turns consist of him freezing my board with Blizzard and Frost Nova and me unable to do anything  Next two turns I cant kill him due to Ice Block  Following turn he OTKs me from 30 health  And I thought freeze mage would go away with the rotating of Ice Lance\", \"commentId\": \"34923\", \"commentDate\": \"1491691596\"},

released DELIBERATELY broken to push the sales of packs to people who are happy to win playing a broken mechanic  The need for a nerf was OBVIOUS within a few HOURS of the release  Blizzard will let
