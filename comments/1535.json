where you say your APM has been so high you played Raza the Chained and used your hero power afterwards so quickly that it still cost you two mana and it didnt yet register the hero power as being

opponent drew betterD I think reno and the new secret card is good together  MC puts down every secret  so you are closer to draw your reno or dragons  maybe Nzoth  The deck what u dont see always in ladder  is not necessarily stupid\", \"commentId\": \"32251\", \"commentDate\": \"1486997720\"}, {\"comment\": \"When did I say that exactly Anyway  first the guy never mentioned MC I suppose whoever makes a Deck like that would use that card  still were not sure about that and it would be 1 in 30 chance of drawing it    And dont even get me started on how much those Secret suck on their own    and  second even Renolock that can abuse the most broken Hero Power in the game is inconsistent  let alone a Deck that is based on 3 mechanics all with their own synergies  doesnt have such reliable card draw and is being played in a meta  whose games are decided almost always by what you draw in the first 3 turns     Also Ive never said the Deck was stupid I was just pointing out that the OPs salt is somehow justified by the fact that a Deck like that needs a godlike draw to stand a chance\", \"commentId\": \"32252\", \"commentDate\": \"1486999054\"}, {\"comment\": \"Its really getting bad  100 draw and matchup luck now   You cant possibly deal with fucking pirate asshole decks with anything midrange at all and then you also cant deal with renolock or mage spell fuckhead decks either   So  it really is simply a matchup lottery   Then  the first few draws  dictate the fucking game   Nothing you can do unless you are willing to be a prick and play one of the cancer decks which are basically Reno  shaman or warrior based   You dont stand a fucking chance against any of this shit unless they draw terrible and you draw perfect   Even then    taunts mean nothing   Reno cancels out any progress youve made   Its so fucking useless    so sad too   Game has a lot of potential but they MUST make it so ANY deck and class is viable  not just fucking shaman  warrior and warlock\", \"commentId\": \"32253\", \"commentDate\": \"1487003198\"}, {\"comment\": \"Heres why I think its bad right now   yadda yadda yadda pirates and aggro shaman  reno is purely did you draw reno by turn 6   blah blah blah    scratch all of that   Its part of it  but just a symptom   Why I think its bad right now is because decks seem to be a certain strength  regardless of who is playing them   If I lose  it feels purely like it was draw RNG   If I win  it was purely draw RNG   It doesnt feel like your decisions really contribute that much to a winrate    If a better player pilots a deck  their winrate should be significantly higher on average   but thats not really the case right now    You could pick up a tier 1 deck having never played it before and pretty reasonably expect to hit rank 5 or better in a short order   I remember when hitting rank 10 was difficult  and then hitting rank 5 was rewarding    now its just a question of do I want to sell my soul and grind a top tier deck to rank 5 or not  When midrange shaman started I think is when it started going in this direction  but now its more prevalent than ever   The next expansion will determine if I continue with this game or not   I suspect many others feel the same\", \"commentId\": \"32254\", \"commentDate\": \"1487003698\"}]"
