the worst META ever   If you are unlucky enough to run into your counters every time like me there is NOTHING you can do and you lose   Just because the ladder already decided that you must play with a deck specifically made to crush you   This is so unfair    At least in the MID SHAMAN meta everyone was playing the same thing so you had a decent chance   In this meta when I play jade druid I only get shaman  I switch to reno mage   Priest appears out of nowhere   I switch to shaman I get the only control warrior on the ladder   ITS SO STUPID   I CANT STAND THIS ANYMORE\", \"commentId\":

arenas from now on  Ladder system now is like Archthief Rafaam I like your deck  It would be SUCH a shame to run into your counter huh The thing on the ladder now is that Hunter now has the most

often works as intended and at the very beginning of most games I can predict the outcome playing as a reno mage against aggresive decks at least for me  win playing same deck vs any jade  lose  Suprisingly enough I face a lot of jade decks and not being able to win anyhow beside switching my own deck to a different one is kinda sad    especially that I want so badly to play reno mage  Ive crafted so many cards for it only to get sad every time I encounter jades  Ladder for me every month is like I get to that damn 15 rank chest and forget bout the cancer  but nope  Whenever I play casuals I get to play against extreme face aggro fiesta and just simply cant test decks for fun  cuz I get obliterated  Honestly  I have no idea what to feel about the current meta beside its pretty disgusting and does not encourage experimenting at all  I wish I could homebrew deck and get at least ok results after testing and teching right cards  The only things that left me are salty tears after spending cash and dust\", \"commentId\": \"30345\", \"commentDate\": \"1483306970\"}, {\"comment\": \"I fucking hate this card too  I can accept its fair that it can steal a card  But it doesnt seem fair that it can steal a minion so many times more valuable than its own worth or cost   I appreciate  as someone else posted  that you can play around it  that is  by attempting to not place more than 3 minions on the board at any time  But that is frustrating and at times  boring  What I despise about the card is it makes the game entirely about RNG  It could steal my 66 or my 11   The entire tide of the game turns on a coin toss  I know there are other cards that have that effect too  I hate them as well  And FWIW  I dont play them \", \"commentId\": \"30346\", \"commentDate\":

basically all Shaman decks   I got to rank 12 last season with a Paladin deck  Id like to think this means I am at least a halfdecent player  But it is just infuriating to play against these decks  Pirate warriors have me dead or basically dead by round 4 or 5  9 times out of 10  Its just IM IN CHARGE NOW AND WHO GOES THARRRRR and then Im fucked  And the game is encouraging this at the moment  If all you want is to win  and win as fast as possible  I suppose this makes sense   But for those of us who might enjoy a reasonable game with mixed classes and deck varieties it is a really bad time to be playing  Which is too bad  because when Hearthstone is fun  it is really enjoyable\", \"commentId\": \"30352\", \"commentDate\": \"1483314669\"}, {\"comment\": \"i fucking swear i could hit rank
