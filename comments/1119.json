"[{\"comment\": \"I too played quite a lot Shaman last month and this month  I feel everyone knows how to counter them by now and have proper techs against them  I only played Midrange though  I switched to Dragon Warrior  and that was able to carry me to rank 5 at least  In my opinion Zoo feels more consistent than Shaman or Hunter for ladder  I would suggest you maybe try that out  and it doesnt have all the RNG Shaman has like totem rolls and lightning storm etc  which are game winninglosing and can be frustrating  Zoo is obviously fairly cheap dust wise  hence why ladder has quite a bit of it\", \"commentId\": \"23366\", \"commentDate\": \"1469833605\"}, {\"comment\": \"Alright  but is it worth saving 700 gold for wing 2 of BRM to get Imp Gang Boss I already have the first wing

more time thinking about your turn and your opponents turn and try to identify what you are doing wrong  Sometimes  I agree  yes  its merely bad luck but it souldnt be that impactful at end season 10 ranks people are misplaying a lot and taking time to think about your plays should correct this randomness factor significantly  Btw no  theres no hidden deck that people play in secret to ladder with  dragon warrior  shaman and hunter are awesome to ladder with 2  You just relax  try out some decks you did not try before why not Token Druid for instance The deck is very strong and is fun to play  The guys you are facing often do not now how to face some decks and combos they are not accustomed to and could make deadly mistakes quite often over extending  neglecting board control  etc Anyway
