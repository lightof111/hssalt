better win rate than aggro cards then its unfair to say its the communities fault  Majority of the players play decks that get them wins  and aggro proves to be more viable  like given two cars to

wins  this is so unfair    No  its not unfair  There is nothing keeping you from constructing a similar deck type  If a particular deck type is more successful  it makes sense to want to build it  If you have a terrible win rate with control type decks  and you will  because control is very lousy in this meta  then you can either a bring your control decks into casual to practice without having it affect your rank or b stop playing control decks   It seems like midrange decks are where its at  though Tempo Mage seems to be ridiculously powerful in the meta right now\", \"commentId\": \"27045\",

this or fck you  But with Hearthstone   Honestly one or two expansions without anythind done and I think the game will really start to suffer  I would even hazard a guess that the game isnt faring
