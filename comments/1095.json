like it  It feels kinda odd but it wasnt an overnight thing  Ive been losing interest for a long time  Gave up ladder because I might as well play the fucking lottery or go to the race track  And playing a mediocre deck and getting steamrolled by all the mages and paladins and rogues in arena is not fun  Drafting a godlike deck and destroying people in clearly unfair matchups isnt my idea of fun nor my idea of competition either  Theres not a playmode in the game that isnt broken as fuck  the last brawl was a slotmachine which is not all that much different from ladder which I want to get AWAY from when I play a brawl  Arena and ladder is the same old same old every single goddamn time you play  Only time you meet anything other than paladin  mage and rogue in arena is before 1 win  or the occassional FUCKING ZOO in arena now thanks to the last expansion  Apparently pretty easy to be other people and draft tentacles and have the combo with 10000 Councilmen and knifejugglers juggling and fucking circus freaks everywhere and godlike opening hands with flame imps and 13 game deciding taunts  just like ladder only more unfair because you can have unlimited fucking copies  Played a shaman who managed to get 2 dr 4s and a 65 on the board  Tell me how that is fun for anyone Do you enjoy steamrolling people because you were lucky to draft a better deck  Because Ive come to the realization that when I do the same  it doesnt feel good and it isnt fun  Meeting 6 paladins in a row and then meeting 10 mages in a row and seeing nothing else is just plain stupid and boring  Ive had the luxury of being able to play rogue  the best class in arena like 90 of the time in the last 30 or so runs but honestly Im getting mighty tired of feeling obligated to play a class just because it way surpasses all the other options  Would love to play some shaman in arena for a change  but of course once I do get the option I dont have the luck of the draw  Found myself spending the last of my gold retiring half ass decks early rather than being steamrolled because theres no fun in that and not worth the time or effort   On the upside Ive been getting into the hype of a certain new Augmented Reality game lately A breath of fresh fucking air coming from this stinking cornhole of a game  and a really exciting time to be a gamer But unfortunately it hasnt been released in asia yet so all I can do is read and watch videos about it  But man will I get on that once its out here and I will be taking a hiatus from Hearthstone for sure  In fact that hiatus seem to have started already because I get more joy out of even doing something as silly as reading the PoGo subreddit than  actually playing Hearthstone  Ill probably stick around complaining and reading other salty posts here for a while though for a long time Ive spent more time in this thread than actually playing because its simply more fun  theres no fun left in the actual game for me\", \"commentId\":
