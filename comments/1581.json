shit with the nerf hammer All these unfair piece of shit broken cards  During beta this game was perfectly balanced  Agro  Midrange and Control were all viable  No rock  paper sizzor matchups  Every matchup was playable  Start a new account play without the latest expansions and youll see what I mean  It feels fair and you can make some mistakes without losing the game  You didnt need god draws to turn a losing game into a win  A 1010 minion used to cost 10 mana in the old days  4 mana 45 without effect used to be strong but it was perfectly balanced  These days  If you dont have a play or answer for 1 turn you lose  Because all of these free 55s  88s and higher cards  Mountain giants should be the only cards who you can play for low costs  No Someone thought lets make this card that lets you summon 1010 minions for 1 mana  But that isnt strong enough Lets give it the ability to put more of this broken unfun cards in your deck  Then when players can play gadgetzan auctioneer a card that allows you to draw your entire deck  but isnt broken at all    and fill there board with 1mana 1010s  Now this is really fun and balanced     What gets nerfed 2 cards  But the most broken shit that ever has hit hearthstone will rule the meta for another year Great I hope the next expansion will fix hearthstones current problems  because the game is not fun anymore and has become a

Priest  Whos fucking idea was it when they created this game to say hey lets make Priest have this crippling weakness Cant wait for Azure Drake to rotate  Card is literally a fucking wall for Priest  Cant hard remove it  cant AOE it dont suggest Auchenai  Circle because its not seeing any use in this meta fuck son all you can do is spam the threaten emote until you somehow build a board against 1 spell damage so you can trade into it  Someone really needs to make a Priest list that uses Auchenai Circle  sick of generic Dragon Priest here we left 3 spots open for tech cards deck and Reno Priest hey look at this new Reno Priest that I changed 1 card from the last guy who also changed 1 card from the last guy so my deck is actually the same as the original deck  Diversity motherfucker  I need

agree  Priest is already so strong  with so many removal like warriors  Every class has to have some kind of weakness  so its only fair priest has one weakness aswell  Shadow word pains  that dragon that destroys a 3 attack minion  shadow word death  entombs  plus they often get even more removal with dragon operative a card thats just way too OP imo  but yeah  priests should be buffed even more
