\"Make no mistake  card games like hearthstone especially are extremely luck based   The luck factor comes into play multiple times throughout the game too  not just here and there   Lets review right at the matchup screen you have luck since drawing the wrong matchup for your deck is an automatic loss   Then  you have starting cardmulligan luck  If your starting hand is bad with anything other than super greedy control decks you are probably done  Game is too tempo based to start poorly   Then  during the game you have tons of other card based RNG like ping damage  sylvanas  rags  every other random effect you can think of   Then  you have your base card draw each turn   Total luck    did you draw what you needed No Game over   Sorry   Its just a big casino   Thats fine  Ive accepted it   Ive also accepted that to rank up you simply must play an overpowered cancer deck   Otherwise  ya lose a lot   It is what it is  Those are the facts\", \"commentId\": \"34191\", \"commentDate\":
