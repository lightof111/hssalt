\"What I hate about hearthstone   Broken expansion meta decks left to run on ladder while Blizzard sells expansion packs  too slow to nerf  Handful of common netdecks faced over and over and over again  No autosquelch  No penalty for rope timer abuse  Insufficient separation of standard  wild  and casual decks  Huge swings in game state due to random effects  Matchmaking appears suspiciously  deterministic nonrandom  Uncraftable cards if you havent purchased an adventure  Excessive dust penalty for dustingcrafting cards  Extreme draw sensitivity   Its just a shitty game that seems good initially  but after a while    its crap  Never spend money on this shit until they address some of these issues\", \"commentId\": \"36019\", \"commentDate\": \"1493091583\"}, {\"comment\": \"HOW THE

WTF blizz  I am almost about to quit this game  The climb for legend seems nice  but this year i dont even feel bad i didnt reach it   On a low note  im pissed that cancer huntard somehow made it back into the meta  Honestly if you want to play that brainless shit then be my guest  Youll never see me play anymore original decks and have fun with this game blizzard  I am no longer giving you my fucking money for such a shit experience   I kid you not  and im sure anyone could agree  if you hand huntard to blind  old man joseph  he could literally drag his fingers from his side of the board to the enemy face and just fucking win if he did it enough  ITS SUCH A BRAINLESS DECK PLEASE PLEASE STOP  FOR FUCKSAKE TRY MAKING AN ORIGINAL DECK  STOP TRYING TO CLIMB FOR ONE GOD DAMN GAME AND HAVE
