than deal 6  Fandrals adds a new form to every choose one card  so the third form of wrath is obviously deal 4 damage  draw a card  However  he does not cast two wraths one for damage and one for draw he casts one wrath which is the combined  3rd form  Casting one spell means 1 spell damage  I assume youre pretty new to how Fandral works\", \"commentId\": \"22949\", \"commentDate\":
