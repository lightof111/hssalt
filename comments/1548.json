"[{\"comment\": \"Its reasonable to see decks that can win easily without skill required on tournaments  because the goal on the tournament is to win  not to get fun  The real problem is on the ladder  Of course you want to rank up  but why there is no difference between rank 19 and rank 5 Same decks  same skill level  You wonder why because this aggro decks are just autopilot and there is a lot of players with an average skill of rank 15 that are on rank 5 only because they are getting carried by his deck  Thats the main problem and the game is basically a waste of time when 10 of 10 games you start against the same cards  The games on ladder are like adventures bosses  just doing the same everytime and you have to find the way to win  or to not lose most of the times  if the RNG is in your side  It seems people cant play for fun anymore  and thats not only for Hearthstone  it happens in all games from today  People always want to win and forget the concept of fun  Just easy wins  disrespect other ones  cry when you lose  This is how the community of videogames works today  and thats why all of them are shitty\", \"commentId\": \"32503\", \"commentDate\": \"1487526602\"}, {\"comment\": \"I am a player since Beta Hearthstone  and Im sad to say that the game has never been more boring than ever  I remember Huntertaker and how stupid it was  and now  as Im facing over 90 aggro decks in CASUAL The official description of casual is Find an opponent of simillar skill and play for fun and while Im experimenting with a new and creative and fun and bright deck  people usually spam me emotes  mocking me of my attempt at having fun without going face until I get 30 wins per day for my daily 100 gold   Perhaps the meta will change  but until then  theres nothing else to say  except that there has never been an expansion in Hearthstone with so much repetitiveness and there has never been an expansion where so little creative decks have been created  Perhaps we can hope for the future of this game to be brighter  I am a paid player  and I have a full collection  and Ive had a chance to experience the full fun of Hearthstone  but this game is getting more expensive  while being less fun with all the aggro decks roaming around  An interesting fact I have noted  is that on 21 of my 30 games against either Aggro Shaman  Pirate Warrior or Pirate Rogue  they would make a huge missplay  with about 30 of them conceding after making that error  They either spam I will crush youI will be your deathThe elements will destroy you or they just add me after game  spamming me more about how skillful aggro decks can be\", \"commentId\": \"32504\", \"commentDate\": \"1487527752\"}, {\"comment\": \"yea people love to mock    they act like kids     in fact

\"Im not saying aggro Warrior and Shaman are bad  but I think most of the folks complaining about them being OP havent really played them  Ive been testing out Pirate Warrior and Pirate Shaman and its not any more easy to grind the ladder than running a bunch of the other random crap that I like to play  The only real upside is that they are faster  Its not like you queue up with aggro shaman and go 1000 all the way to legend    If people arent playing aggro themselves  then they are playing insane antiaggro and you winning or losing is a coin flip at best either way  Hopefully the nerfs help because the game is fucked either way right now  Hunter is dead  most decks are the same  grimy goons is failed mechanic which sucks because it might be the best anti Jade mechanic post nerfs and all the old meta had been nerfed out of existence or made unplayable due to power creep and pirates  Standard rotation should solve some of the issues  but hopefully it doesnt create more   I dont know for sure when the best meta was  but I think the most fun was around the Midrange Paladin days  It wasnt the 1 deck  but it could beat a lot of the best decks and it was fun to play  Lots of thinking and decisions if you made it past the onslaught of Hunters at the time   Even back then aggro was fun to play as and against for some reason  Maybe it felt more fair since you could make it to turn 7

me after a match just to insult me and run away in Casual  like usual  but is that somehow okay if I was playing pirates All I got was lol playing cancer at rank 10  ft My thoughts are this  Yes  Turn 1 STB into turn 2 Coin  dagger  STB is pretty lucky  but Im so used to my pirates getting blasted  I figured you might have had a Volcanic Potion or something   Im sorry for the Wow emote  but your turn 3 concede genuinely surprised me  I shouldnt rub salt into wounds  maybe you were have a bad run of the day  I apologize   Yes  I have pirates in my deck  because it makes it work better  Honestly I feel like Rogues should be the ones allowed to play pirates with a hero power like that   Since you didnt concede right when you saw I was Rogue  Im sorry I wasnt playing a more pure nonpirate Miracle Rogue like Im supposed to  but I dont have Edwin  Also I dont even know you   Maybe if youd played past turn 2  youd have seen the rest of my cancer Jade NZoth Rogue\",

is probably with priest  But fuck  I just cant win  I think my average win rate is probably 23 wins  Sometimes with priest Ill go 56 wins  But it seems like my opponent always has better cards  My last few games Opponent drops fucking Alakir out of nowhere  Takes out my 53 and a 22  and then I have to trade in to it of course  Wheres my god damn legendariesAnd the one time I actually get kazakhas  and proceed to build a deck around it  I end up facing another fucking player with it  Jesus christ    and then my resses a fucking 11  Awesome Shamans with 77s on turn 4  Priests with endless buffs  like their entire fucking hand is filled with Velens Chosen  Or that Warlock who has the Blastcrystal Potion in hand just at the right moment Jesus  I thought Hearthstone ranked was
