rogues  not only you are playing a 50  50 getagoodhandorloseasfuck deck but you are such a horrible unskilled idiots  Met two times the same Q rogue on rank 6 and he literally missed lethal in both games because his mind couldn t handle  Now  the 3rd game against a miracle rogue and he is again a complete disgrace of a human being  He played 4 cards during his turn and at the end he traded Sherazin  well you could trade for free and then resurrect it you idiot  I m literally tired of playing against Rogues whose minds are twisted and broken yet they win because Rogue\", \"commentId\":

blizzard listens  WHICH WILL NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE IT IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL  So pick up your bags and go  I am warning  you for your own best interests  ESPECIALLY if you like to throw a little money around but also if you like to invest your time hoping for a good returnbetter times  This is why hearthstone sucks and will remain to suck 1  Netdecking  Reading threads and posts about stale metas and cancer decks This is because hearthstone is f2p and has rediculously high crafting costs  not allowing f2pers to get a full collection  thus them resorting to the cheapest  most efficient and proven decks  2  The meta is gargabe because of reason 1 and because of reason  3 reason 4 and reason 5  Furthermore  you have reason 6  There are no fun queues so you will always be stuck against the same decks  New expansion NICE the metas keep settling faster and faster  Pretty soon you will have 72h to enjoy a peak of creativity before people start slamming giant weapons in your face again and sprinkling that salt in the wounds  Meanwhile you come to hearthpwn to rant about your terrible experiences  and these cocksuckers come and refute your bad experience saying its your own damn fault   3  The community  The community is really freaking dumb first and foremost  and the vast majority of the community do not play cardgames  have no experience cardgames  do not understand cardgames  and also dont understand that hearthstone is a cardgame  This will continue to make problems for the legit players that are interested in exploring and creativity  because you will always be brushing up again the cancergrindingmajority  since there is no way to escape see reason 4 4  Gold rewards3wins  This incentivizes players to play for speed  to grind out games faster is to get more free stuff faster  People tend to use fast decks  regardless of if they enjoy them or not  5  Aggro will always prevail  The parameters of hearthstone are essentially built to benefit aggro  The first one to drop a minion has the benefit of choice and can always go face  Not being able to block makes this uninteractive and will always favor the starting player  Look at arena for a demonstration of this principle  6  Queues  There is no fun mode  Yeah  think about that  it actually says a wholefuckinlot  Tavernbrawl you might say Yeah lets look at this forum and see if we can find decks shall we I agree that tavern brawls are usually fun the first day or maybe two  After that its just fucking ranked pirate fiesta  if only they could have their way here aswell huh Bonus Reason  Blizzard is terrible at recognizing and adapting their games to the public  Furthermore  it will always continue to follow and or improve their business model  Beforerather then the customer base and its needs  This gives you some insight for the future  if you are not that experienced with blizzard  i am looking at you influx of people for overwatch andor Hearthstone They will take your money     I am fucking done with this game\", \"commentId\": \"35567\", \"commentDate\": \"1492522092\"}, {\"comment\": \"WIld side player here I am salty  because in Wild The Pirate warrior is still

play with others and you can name the requirements  so you know who you queue up with like if this were here  we could say  no aggro decks or only Cthun  or only fun decks etc this would be essential

deck  Today i had a bad experience against it and i just reminded myself  why i got bored with hs this season  To all of you  who say  fast decks beat it  use Dirty Rat  screw you  If you think that teching 2 rats in there  will help you in most of the cases  you are wrong  Unlike the other combo decks  where you have TIME to establish a board or at least to have the mana for when you rat your opponent  and then destroy the minion  Its turn 4 or 5 and they are near to finish it  you play your rat and They can bounce it back  if you you cant do anything for the remaining 2 or 3 mana  And one more thing  Why do you always encourage aggro decks to be played Before I continue  know this  JUST BECAUSE A DECK HAS COUNTERS  IT DOESNT MEAN THAT ITS NOT DEGENERATED  Absolutely the same case with PW last season  hard counters like CW countered it  but the deck was UNIVERSAL  Now you play him as your saviour against the QR or the other fast decks  which were underwhelmed by PW last season  but thats ok  because you can finally play those decks  What about slower decks Nah  they are for casuals only   But no  Im writing this post  just to point out some consistencies  that go in the QRs favour they abuse the charge mechanic a 1 mana deckhand pulls a free patches  if the rogue played the quest reward  that is 10 damage for 1 mana 13 of the heros health and even more with every bouncer combo decks before ungoro needed Emperor almost always with exception of miracle rogue and A LOT OF MANA completing the deck early on its not a welldesigned card  it just encourages ANOTHER BROKEN DECK TO BE PLAYED PW and DONT TELL ME THAT ROGUE FINALLY GOT A STRONG DECK thats not just strong  its unbalanced  RNG and why i am so pissed  The Slashburglers compensate the player going all in  It not just a minion  that triggers patches  it leaves value after himself  And when you finally clear their board or you are struggling with it  they just mock you with the extra value they get  even more with every bouncer giving them more resources Edwin  ffs this even gets a buff  it gets additional 33 stats and it grows even bigger  if this minion should change its stats  then only on the board with buff spells  not with the effect of its own and if their board is threatening enough  you have to spend a big portion of your mana and sometimes even the whole turn just to clear the board  you can use expensive board clears like Dragonfire potion or Fellfire Potion  because they are expensive you cannot establish a board after that and these harm your own minions  While the rogue player can spam cheap tokens on the board  of they have charge  they can trade with your minions and the bouncers keep them fresh  I dont find this to be that of a big problem  but only in the cases  when they complete the quest early  And because they have the ability to do it very often  I suggest the quest would be nerfed to 5 minions  4 minions is way too easy Note Fuck all of you hypocrites  that said the rogue quest was weak and 3 weeks later they play it as if they are the biggest rogue fans out there  You play the deck just because its way too strong  AND YOU KNOW IT   I sincerely apologize to those people  who have fun playing QR  because the task is not straightforward  as the other ones like playing XXX Y timesNote 2  the deck is really powerful  but not in a good way  You cannot ignore that and say It has counters  play them  because the decks like PW are also busted and WE SHOULDNT ENCOURAGE BUSTED DECKS TO BE PLAYED Note 3  I repeat some things  because people ignore them in the rant threads  They all go with the typical use this  use that    Anyway if someone read my post  thx for the attention\", \"commentId\": \"35574\", \"commentDate\": \"1492525690\"},
