him one moment until Gadgetzan came out with all the single card deck synergy    I crafted  the btard again  And yes  Reno still sucks Hes no fun to compete against nor to compete with  Your deck is so unorganized and you depend on winning based on the fact that your opponent cannot take such an anomally into consideration when deckbuilding  Its winning because your deck sucks so hard your opponent didnt believe youd choose  it When you leave I will sing a song for you Reno Bye  bye Reno Jackson goodbyeDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry     Thisll be the day that you
