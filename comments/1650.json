number of downvotes Ive been getting for my theorycraft Hemet OTK Shaman list  I took a new card and fit it perfectly into an old archetype in a creative way that actually helped it get its win

potential substitutions  I got a ton of positive attention but ever since then  people have just been downvoting it without any feedback  Its actually infuriating to spend time on something and be innovative and then have a bunch of 12 year olds downvote it because their minds are too small to actually think outside of the curvestonesmorcfestdoucherynetdeckingT1decks box\", \"commentId\":

the title and while I agree that it might make it look more crowded  you might be getting down voted because they came looking for a Standard deck and then were disappointed to find a Wild one  It could help curb the negative ratings the deck is receiving  Still a poor reason to down vote but a possible explanation\", \"commentId\": \"34647\", \"commentDate\": \"1491369798\"}, {\"comment\": \"This really concerns me too  Wild is there so we can enjoy many of the great decks of old and to get away from the flavor of the month net decks  But  ehhh    with cancerous fucking shit cards like Reno and many others being shoved into wild  it might make wild suck  Actually  it probably will make wild suck  All of the busted shit will just be there  We already have a pirates problem in wild since the pricks that play retarded decks like that just have to play in wild too  We cant escape  Then well still have cancer aggro shaman with trogg and totem golem along with all of those cheap burst spells  Still see secret paladin too which is completely awful to play against  win or lose    If standard mode becomes a 3 deck cancer festival and wild offers no relief  this game could really be hurting as far as fun goes  Gosh I hope not\", \"commentId\": \"34648\", \"commentDate\": \"1491384321\"}, {\"comment\": \"I cant wait for Dragon Priest cancer shit to go the opposite way of the

to nerf STB  Claws  not based on any source data  Brann  Kazakus is busted  Dr  6 is still busted  Pirate synergy is still busted  Wild can only become a fullon rockpaperscissors meta where certain
