know  Lucky I guess  Then I queue into patron Wairrors  I was playing Patron Warrior til rank 6 then saw the time right to switch  Only once is 10 or 15 games did I get the PERFECT OPENER  I played 5 of them  ALL had perfect openers Fiery War Axe  Acolyte of Pain  Deaths Bite  Grim Patron  Inner Rage     I think Im on an unlucky streak here    Luckily I made it to rank 5 in time\", \"commentId\":

Freeze Mages have Alexstrasza turn 8 after Emperor Thaurissan on 6 followed by exactly Frostbolt  2 Ice Lance  Fireball on turn 9 and my CThun is always in the bottom 3 cards  but the opponent always has it on 10 after a great boostingcurve  Not too mention the Leeroy  PO combo on turn 6 with only 2 cards in hand  Lol  sometimes this games makes me so salty because non of the above situation has anything to do with skill or outplaying the opponent  I just have to keep grinding bad players until Im top 100 again\", \"commentId\": \"21665\", \"commentDate\": \"1466124186\"}]"
