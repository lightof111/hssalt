cost in the game 4 77 wtf  Come on  their hero power isnt bad enough to justify all that  Oh but wait lets also have the best inspire card in the game there for good measure  While were at it  how about the best 2 drop in the game as well  Not to mention the most rng related  win if I get flametongue  3 drop  Oh you rolled  a mana tide  great I cant waste resources on that so have some free bloody cards   Hm    no that hero power still sucks though  oh I know lets give them a 55 taunt that costs 0 by the time they draw it  what a great idea  perfect for control  in no way could aggressive decks abuse this card  Jeez    we really should put some drawback here  oh of course overload  Not like that can be abused from turn one  Ooh Totem Golem and that 1 overload really feels like a punishment doesnt it    2 overload on a 77  yeah that should do it  In fact scrap that  their hero power still looks poor  oh lets give them some cards that completely negate the drawbacks of others  oh damn that seems like a good idea  But hey  at least they cant just give three attack to anything  right Doomhammer  but that card is fine  it has overload on it  yeah 2 seems to make it unplayable enough  whod want a windfury weapon anyway  better give it more durability than anything else in the game   Lol  shamans  With that hero power the class must really suck\", \"commentId\":
