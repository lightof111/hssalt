slow and its not enough    Its really problematic     The rankings need to change and those pleps who sck at the game should be obligated to think for once in their miserable life    You wanna play

get Reno again  If I switch to Rogue with Beneath the Grounds to fuck up Renos  Ill either get aggro or Beneath is within the last 5 cards in the deck  No matter what  RNG just fucks me most of the

wins with who is level 29   I was like wow  he must be a super high level then and he replied Hes probably level 60   What kind of matchmaking is that  Seriously   He and I were both rank 20 but otherwise it was like the equivalent of someone only having wrestled in elementary school deciding to take on the Rock and calling it a fair match up or at least in my opinion anyways   I also get paired up all the time with people that have tons of legendarys in their deck when I have none  but even that I can tolerate I guess      what factors are used for matchmaking anyone know Also  ever had a game end like this I know there is a video forum but its 420am and Im too tired to post somewhere else after this so Im including it  I actually have the whole match but it was ridiculously long

matched against people with your winrate  So if you win a lot  you will get harder competition  if you lose a lot  you will meet easier opponents  And btw  golden hero doesnt mean he is skilled  It might be more likely since he is obviously playing a lot longer than you  but I know people who are playing this game casually since beta and are not good at all of course they dont care to get better
