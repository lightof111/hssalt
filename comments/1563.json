the expansions and adventures that the game would have more diversity than this  I am not exaggerating that every single class in the meta appears to be pingenholed into one deck  Reno Mage has become absolutely predictable  Every Paladin buffs  Every Shaman and Druid is Jade and so forth  This is more disheartening than losing because winning doesnt feel very special either  I took a Pirate Warrior dont hate  Im new to PW from 20 to 14 in one sitting  Then I was bored  Then I realized first hand how awfully thin the deck is  Most importantly  I didnt feel like I accomplished anything  I did nothing special but copied a deck and used it  I would be more inclined to brag if my snowflakes ranked that fast but alas  its not going to happen  So we leave that privileged to the select few whose design now reaches out to millions   And therein lies the absolute trap of the game  Play the handful of decks that win or you will lose  Period  Soooo many cards are never seen in play because they cant compete  And when Blizzard makes headscratching decisions like nerfing some aggro cards only to release more broken aggro cards  you know youre screwed   I just ask for diversity  Thats all  And Wild is no better now  All it did was was give these same decks a slightly different look   Terrible\", \"commentId\": \"32817\", \"commentDate\": \"1488054347\"}, {\"comment\": \"wild where the

money making cycle has become so transparent  release a bunch of  cards with broken synergies and let them run while people buy the expansion packs to play the new winning decks all the while pretending that they are monitoring things and planning balance and playability changes  Clearly an outright lie  They hold off simple nerfs as long as possible  until either the sales of packs slows maximum cancer flooded the ladder or until complaint from people not playing the broken decks is so loud they are losing players  Then they fix the worst of the broken cards    but soon after release another set of broken cards to repeat their money grubbing cycle  My biggest regret with Hearthstone is ever spending money on packs  Its been almost impossible to enjoy playing the game because season after season is ruined with obviously OP synergies  This season has been pirates and Shamans and dragon priest and Reno decks and Jade Druid  The fact that there are 67 busted deck types makes it no less boring than a pure Aggro Shaman meta  Buy the new cards  play broken decks for 2 months wheeeeee pirates Then do it again with the next broken decks   Wheres the skill Wheres the building up of a collection of playable cards Wheres the facility to take a season off from buying cards and playing something from the previous season The whole game is totally totally fucked\",
