course are obnoxious and super boring to play  Honestly  you dont beat face warrior  you only hope you draw perfectly and they draw terribly   The nerf to STB didnt do a damned thing to help  Its the weapons and the weapon buffs that were and still are the real problem  Then  they drop fucking dread corsair for FREE along with frothing berserker  Great  Then korkron elite  Even if you stabilize you are still fucked  Why Their burst spells and of course Leeroy is coming too   Acidic swamp ooze doesnt help  They just load a new weapon  Harrison jones is useless too since at 5 mana he takes too long to get out there  Standard has no good taunts  Infested Tauren sucks  Other than him    what the fuck taunts are there Even in wild  sludge belcher only helps a little bit since hes too expensive and gets removed by the weapon and or minions  You are ALWAYS reacting against that deck  Reacting in hearthstone usually means losing   Face warrior is the most overpowered  brainless deck ever in the history of this game and it isnt even close  Its fucking sick   Broken  Awful  Just concede and save yourself the wasted time and irritation  Alls we can do is hope blizzard nerfs the shit out of the deck or those who play the deck get sick and fucking die\", \"commentId\": \"33531\", \"commentDate\": \"1489322205\"}, {\"comment\": \"This game doesnt come close to a strategic card game  Its a

like this Lord Jaraxxus is a cool card  there are no decks that can outlast Lord Jaraxxus for more than a couple of turns and win the game You are right  Lord Jaraxxus is indeed a cool card  What is we gave Jaraxxus strength to three classes  but make the following adjustments  Instead of paying 9 mana to have the power  basically passing that turn and limiting your health to 15  they dont have to and have it straight away  From around turn 6 the infernals jades are 66  and every single one gets higher stats Great idea  Lets do that Because thats what Jade is  Theyre free  stronger  endless infernals  Deal with one  next one is right there again  Stronger than the last one  Fuck this\", \"commentId\": \"33537\", \"commentDate\": \"1489332678\"}, {\"comment\": \"Hard to argue this   I mean  I played against a Jade Druid in wild and was using my lategame midrange Paladin deck   I had TWO welltimed and boardclearing eqaulityconsecrates that I played   Ya know what  It didnt fucking matter because after each one they just load the board AGAIN but this time with more 77  88  99  1313  whatever   Are they fucking serious with this stupidity  They must be because its running rampant everywhere   At least when traditional Shamans or zoo decks reload the board its with more manageable minions   Geezus   There is NO way    and I mean NO way to possibly deal with all of that   Druid has too many early tools to stall the game so its prety hard to kil them quickly enough before the onslaught   Fucking Jade is a horrible idea   Nerf it  kill it    goodbye   Idiots\", \"commentId\":
