"[{\"comment\": \"Id like so much to get a ban X class from your matches  Then Id finally get rid of those inbred neckbeard hobo druids and their bullshit  I cant even remember what was the last time I won against a druid  Pirate Warriors  pirate shamans  other shamans  dragon priests and a bit less renolock  I can take that all day  Pirate dragon warriors and miracle rogues are really harsh for me I cant remember beating a miracle rogue neither but at least the only appear once in a while  But druid is fucking everywhere and its an autolose for me no matter what  I bet I could play against a 30 vanilla cards druid and still lose somehow  Its just I want to have a break and live for once in a meta free of druids  But except of Naxx  I know that meta free of druids only exists in my imagination  P D  And fuck Fandrad Staghelm in particular  always appears exactly when they have the exact card that could be comboed with in order to fuck up the rest of my game and at turn 7 at latest\", \"commentId\": \"30064\", \"commentDate\": \"1482628125\"}, {\"comment\": \"Played a few games this morning and all games my opponents had nuts starting hands  Pirate warrior buccaneer  1

a shaman who coined out his weapon on turn 1  played southsea deckhand on turn 2  had another deckhand and bucca on turn 3 and played another weapon on turn 4 with flame totem  Me I played a 36 dragon on turn 4 that got wrecked and I was on 10 hp   And I am cool with that if it werent because most of my starting hands were complete shit  Played a jade druid where I got 1 golem out by turn 6  a buff

happening in Casual mode right now Seems like almost all people play it with top rated hightier decks Its so annoying to see pirate warriors and agroshamans in mode that is supposed to be a funmode  There is a place where people play not for win  but for fun You get almost nothing for wins  except a bit of satisfaction and 13 of 10 gold  I suppose people just get quests like win N games on classname and they take most cancerous and powerful deck for their class to accomplish the task    Or people just grind these 10golds rewards  idk  The most interesting thing here is that  most of new cards from Gadzetzan are so not competitive  not all of them are drafting even in arena  but you cant play them even in Casual mode cuz of Casual mode is filled by ranked decks\", \"commentId\":
