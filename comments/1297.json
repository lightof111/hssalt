have 2x Tinkers Sharpsword Oil in the deck  and i can pretty safely say i use atleast one of them every game  About half of the time  i dont have anything to activate its combo with except playing a minion  Ive been counting how many times Oil has given the buff to the minion i just played  or atleast i tried to count  But i soon switched to counting how many times it didnt hit that one  because that has only happened twice as opposed to hitting the newly played minion somewhere between 1020 times while having 26 other minions in play  Its pretty fucking bullshit when sometimes you dont have
