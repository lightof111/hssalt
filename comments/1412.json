Casual Game Shadowform Priest Me vs  Pirate Warrior Them  Typical game versus a Pirate Warrior  they are smashing my face and my health gets real low real quick  That said  a few well timed top decks in the forms of heals  board clears and an Ooze kept me in the game  I eventually completely recover with a Greater Healing PotionPriest of the Feast combo  The Pirate Warrior has no board  no cards in hand and no weapon equipped  They keep trying for a few turns back to back Korkron Elites and an Arcanite Reaper  However I focus on keeping the board cleared and my health up  They eventually concede and then I get a friend request for them and we had this exchange Them Screw you and your deck  Me Sounds like the Pirate Warrior in Casual is mad because their deck couldnt steamroll in Casual  Them Umm  I had you beat on several turns scrub  Screw you and your BS heals  who runs those cards anyway Your bad and you know it  Your parents are probably ashamed of you   Im unfriend at this point 2  Casual Game Shadowform Priest Me vs  Priest Control  Typical Priest vs  Priest match  clearly going late game  On my side of the board Frost Giant  Refreshment Vendor and Darkshire Alchemist  My opponent has already used both Shadow Word Deaths and Entombs on suboptimal targets in my eyes  I have 15 damage on board  my opponent has no board and 3 cards in hand  All 3 cards are Greater Healing Potion 1 they got from me  Despite my 15 damage on board and my 3 damage Hero power  over the next several turns I have to witness them heal using all 3 Greater Healing Potions  a Darkshire Alchemist and a Flash Heal  I take the Darkshire Alchemist out of the equation and keep hitting their face and they eventually concede  I get trying to keep the game going long enough as they might get SOMETHING that can turn the tides but both Entombs and both SWDs were already gone and they were nearing the end of their deck as it was  Was getting me salty as I was approaching a tunnel On my way into NYC for work and if I entered the tunnel I would have clearly lost the game that I had no place losing due to no service but they finally conceded moments before I entered the tunnel and lost service on my phone  3  Casual Game Shadowform Priest Me vs  Miracle Rogue Them  This particular Miracle Rogue made use of the Red Mana Wyrm card and Ill hand it to them  its the first time Ive ever seen the card played against me  Was pretty cool to see it grow so quickly so insanely fast  It was late game  it was my turn and I had 1 health  I was looking at an 182 Red Mana Wyrm   44 Auctioneer and a Rogue spamming Well Played  I Hero Power Shadowform the Mana Wyrm to clear that threat and then I run my Azure Drake into the Auctioneer and then drop Reno  Rogue concedes and I get a friend request Them Really Reno You are bad at this game and lost Me Actually you conceded  I believe YOU lost  Im unfriended 4  Casual Game  Shadowform Priest Me vs Shaman Face  Shaman gets off to a pretty decent start  Trogg  Golem  Coin  Spirit Wolves  My mulligan and draw were terrible and I was looking dead by turn 5  looking at my potential last draw and see nothing that can save me I concede  I immediately get a friend request  Them Why did you quit Me Terrible mulligandraw  had nothing that would have saved me so I conceded  What does it matter to you Them You are a bad sport and a bad player  you should let the better player smash you into oblivion   Im unfriended\", \"commentId\": \"29606\", \"commentDate\": \"1481894671\"}, {\"comment\": \"Dayuuuum   that was some next
