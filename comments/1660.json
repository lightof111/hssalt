broken the Quests are     On this forum people are already asking for the The Caverns Below to be nerfed     Cmon guys its been just one day Build some new Decks and have fun playing them before the meta settles down     Ive been playing Quest Mage and Handlock yesterday and even though all those Rogues spamming 55 with charge and tryharders playing PW are annoying it was the most fun Ive had in

been building a golden collection so when I craft I only craft in gold   I went to craft a The Last Kaleidosaur in gold and mistakenly crafted a regular   I realized as I close the crafting screen   I immediately disenchanted and crafted it golden and issued a help ticket with Blizzard   I have no idea how they track the collection and crafting and disenchanting but bottom line is they responded and Im shit out of luck  1200 dust thrown away   Its ridiculous that theres no way to protect against a mistake like this   In in the end I fed up and lost a ton of dust\", \"commentId\": \"34851\",

rogues who I all beat  Only one of the rogues I beat actually played properly  I get thats its a new deck and all  and that people arent familiar with it but damn sometimes people need to learn how to think for themselves  Ive seen rogues go in one direction with the quest developing a certain minion several times  to then be stuck at 34 because they didnt think ahead  And most commonly  Ive faced rogues who for some reason think the deck is Complete the quest and win  Just now I met a rogue who went all in with his boar  Great  you can play your quest on turn 5  Only problem is that you only have a boar left as minions  and the rest of it is topdecking  This kind of bullshit makes me understand why so many people play playoncurve decks more and more  A new deck has been released pros havent made guides for yet that isnt straightforward and people at high ranks rank 5 on the 8th day is pretty high already mess up  I guess the lesson here is that its sometimes better to think for yourself and get your own information  instead of getting your information from other sources\", \"commentId\": \"34860\", \"commentDate\": \"1491644195\"}, {\"comment\": \"Pretty much what I thought would happen with the new expansion  a few clearly broken builds which every man and his dog will play to get high on the ladder  Experimentation with different decks pointless  Blizzard will see how many packs they can sell before anything gets nerfed  Ride the rogue quest cancer sheeple   HEARTHSTONE IS NOT A COLLECTIBLE CARD BATTLE GAME WHERE YOU CAN CREATE COMPETITIVE DECKS OF YOUR OWN FROM AN EXISTING COLLECTION  ITS A GAME WHERE EVERY FEW MONTHS YOU PAY TO BUY A SUBSET OF BROKEN CARDS AND PLAY THEM IN ENDLESS ROCK PAPER SCISSOR OR MIRROR MATCHES  Never give Blizzard money for this shit
