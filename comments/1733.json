pirate warrior endlessly all day long BMing you at lethal  2 People rage quitting on you just because they lost control of the board 3 People adding you after and telling you they fucked your mum last night 4 Oh yeah  the aggro player I just played who has lethal and winds down the whole of his turn pointing his burst lethal at each of my minions and my face alternately  hovering over  and then killing me just before he ropes out   If youve ever wondered why hearthstone isnt as good as it could or should be  the answer is because of people\", \"commentId\": \"36350\", \"commentDate\":

{\"comment\": \"You guys ever have those days where nothing you do matters and you just lose game after game if it werent for the new rank system  Im convinced I would have gone from 10 to 20 yesterday  I start the day at 8am with 2 wins for warrior quest  I say screw it and make a pirate deck just to get it done quick and try for first time rank 5  At 11am I still hadnt finished the quest  Nothing but taunt warriors and quest rogues and my draws were pathetic  Weapons in bottom half of deck  terrible value  I finally get my 2nd win 312 hours after I started and decide to ride it out and see if I can get to rank 5  No go  Facing nothing but taunt warriors and getting terrible draws  So  I switch it up to taunt warrior and start facing all hunters and some pirate warriors  Wtf\",

is rather annoying  2  Not sure why this is an issue for you  Anytime someone wants to give me a free win  I take it happily  3  Why are you accepting their request You should know by now that people are overall shitheads  Anyone adding you isnt doing it to genuinely be your friend  4  Agree  this type of shit is the worst  5  Just one of my personal favorites BMing during an RNGfest tavern brawl  like the Yogg tryouts bull crap we had this week  Why do people get off on BMing you as if their ridiculous luck was their accomplishment\", \"commentId\": \"36364\", \"commentDate\": \"1493651770\"}, {\"comment\": \"I created this account just for this  I am making this post in honor of the poor guy who had to withstand this retarded but awesome rng Im playing burn mage vs taunt warrior  Its late game  he has 3minions on board including one armorsmith and one alley armorsmith vs my clear board and he is bouncing from 10 to 12 hp each turn because of the smith hitting my face  He also has his rag hero power out so he cant armor up more then his minions let him he used both shield walls already  I end up at 2 hp with my last block having popped a second ago  no alex cause i used her on him and my hand is full of junk1 pyro  I draw primordial glyph and it gives 2 trash and another primordial glyph  Use the free glyph and get 2 shitters and a cabalist tome i NEED a burn card AND another block to win  I pick cabalist tome and use it  BOOM 1 pyro 1 fireball and 1 block  I have enough mana left to fireball face and block up  Now hes standing at 7 hp and i figure i won  BAM he drops a primordial drake that hits his 3 minions  causing the armorsmith to put him at exactly 10  Im thinking i lost cause the alleysmith will put him at 12 and i can only do 10 a turn atm but then he gets cute and decides its a good idea to put me at 1 BEFORE hitting face with the alleysmith  Seeing as the smith only pops my block and does NO DAMAGE it doesnt activate and hes stuck at 10hp  Next turn i gently use my rng pyro and win the game Rarely have i seen so much rng and never in my favor lol\", \"commentId\": \"36365\", \"commentDate\": \"1493652683\"}, {\"comment\": \"Still waiting for QuestRogues to all drown in their own bile  Am currently 115 against them this season  no matter the deck I run  compared to anywhere between 40 and 70 win rate against everyone else  Tried teching against them  tried going full aggro  tried wiping their board and leaving tons of taunts  nothing works if they pull off the quest  which they nearly always do by turn 5  At least the new QuestMage deck takes more than 5 turns to become infuriating  Oh and whoever created this new AggroDruid trend that has absolutely no thematic consistency  a bunch of generic powerful cheap minions  and then the cheap druid buffs Fuck you  Just fuck you\", \"commentId\": \"36366\", \"commentDate\": \"1493653876\"}]"
