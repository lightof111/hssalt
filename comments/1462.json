why it had to become aggressive again  Thats why even though they keep printing very powerful priest cards  decks with strong early game and some burst continue to dominate  People can complain about op 5 drops all they want but the real problematic cards are in the 12 drop area  Start with a hand of 5 drops and you are gone  It cant be healthy for a game that you usually have to get on board by turn 2 at least if you want to stand a good chance of winning  But well  its not like a couple of million likeminded players have not pointed that out enough over the last few years\", \"commentId\":

to stop the wave of pirates and suddenly jade druids are appearing  So I tried anyfin paladin and get matchup with dragon priest  easy loss because they steal my anyfin  This is probably just being unlucky  but It happens way to often as it seems  Also it is probably because Im low rank  but it happens from rank 1910  Also everyone complaining about warriors  I still fucking hate shamans  any version except control because they are still broken  aggro decks with more boardclears than most midrange decks\", \"commentId\": \"30692\", \"commentDate\": \"1483868222\"}, {\"comment\": \"Ugh  I really want to play an arena run  but seeing all these insane drafts on stream is really discouraging   Generally I wouldnt call myself insanely unlucky  sure I do have insanely unlucky moments but I guess everyone does  But when it comes  to arena I am insanely unlucky  I never draft legendaries only once in something like 30 runs  and all the options were shit  never draw straight up OP cards such as piloted shredder  and never get any synergy whatsoever  So yeah  thats why I try to stay away from arena\", \"commentId\": \"30693\", \"commentDate\": \"1483869632\"}, {\"comment\": \"I dont think its weird that Blizzard makes certain dumb archetypes like aggro warrior and aggro shaman strong  because thats obviously how they attract crowds of idiots with money  All I want is a deck that is very good  but also has a very high skill floor  You know  something like old patron warrior but not broken  and preferably more interactive\", \"commentId\": \"30694\", \"commentDate\":

happens  Just horrible cards  just a bunch of rares  no epics nor legendaries  Almost no spells  no boardclear  no lategame at all  Get destroyed by decks that have synergies just like in ranked  And
