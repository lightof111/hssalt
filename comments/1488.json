{\"comment\": \"Or maybe I didnt share that experience Allow me to explain  because obviously you got a hard on when you saw a comment you didnt agree with and your troll instincts immediately kicked in  leaving you incapable of cognitive functioning I saw a decent amount of mid shaman  sure  but I currently see a significant amount more pirate warrior  If its not pirate warrior  its pirate rogue  If its not pirate rogue  its jade druid or dragon priest  Just about every pirate warrior deck is identical  every dragon priest is identical  and there are maybe 2 versions of jade druid  Thats it  Even every Reno deck is identical  Before MSG each class had multiple decks  and multiple versions of those decks   I am speaking to my experience with Hearthstone  so please dont activate troll mode

decks so i was happy about thati didnt really see a lot of them  Anyway the last 34 days i started to really get a LOT of Pirate Warrior  and horrible draws  so i started to fall back  So i switch decks to my aggro techd Dragon Priest  and immediately get matched up against nothing but Handlock and mirror matchthe aggro techs dont help me in these matches  Today i decided to play my first match as my Reno Priest again  Ill give you one guess which deck i get matched with         so fcking irked   rank 14 right now        like 520 last 3 days\", \"commentId\": \"31231\", \"commentDate\":
