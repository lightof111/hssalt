say my luck is average  There is only one card I would say Im INCREDIBLY unlucky with  and that is Ragnaros the Firelord  Ive honestly lost a lot of games because of the random on that card  For example  cancer shaman plays Ragnaros on an empty board  I follow it up with my own Ragnaros next turn  plus play an additional Arcane Anomaly was experimenting  Ofcourse my Rag snipes his 30 hp face  while his Rag snipes my 13 Rag  even though I had 30 hp left  That 12 followed by a 13 lost me the game  I literally had 0 5 x 0 33 16 5 chance to lose the game  and it happened  And this is not the first time  Ive honestly considered swapping Rag with RNGfree cards in my deck just because of my terrible experiences with it\", \"commentId\": \"27995\", \"commentDate\": \"1479376861\"},

playing it at all    I only play for max an hour a day right now  bc the ladder is boring and if I play  i will most likely play my tempo mage  bc I dont feel completly lost vs shamans  This helps me

loosing streaks\", \"commentId\": \"28014\", \"commentDate\": \"1479397371\"}, {\"comment\": \"So I tried out this Tavern Brawl  I finished with 63  playing Malygos Druid  but the way I lost the games is fucking ridiculous  I knew I wont make it far due to my extensive unluck but come on  8 SHAMANS  and 1 hunter  I lost 2 games because of a single 5050  Get it Nothing else  I played perfect  but good bye 1000 gold because I cannot win a single 5050  8th game against shaman  I came back from 2 hp on turn 5  but the last shaman gave me no chance  I was dead on turn 45  FUN FACT Not a single shaman missed Trogg  GolemFlametongue on the first 2 turns  One of them even had double Trogg  Golem  Surprisingly I won that game  but doesnt justify this shit Shamanstone called a game  Only Shamans and RNG  for the 231246th time  great job Blizzard\", \"commentId\": \"28015\", \"commentDate\": \"1479399730\"}]"
