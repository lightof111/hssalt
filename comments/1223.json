rampdruid  he had perfect cards from turn 1 but played like absolute shite  allowing me to come back with Deathwing  He plays rag into it hits it  I am at 12 life  he has the hunter heropower  I draw a Bog Creeper  he is at 24 and has 1 card left  I decided to go face  since he plays facewarrior and knowing my luck will draw chargers to kill me  He had nothing as expected  so if rag hits the creeper or my face i win  Rag hits deathwing  Ok not cool  but since he misplayed and ran his charger into my creeper when he could not kill it for some reason  I am still in good shape  hit his face with the creeper and heropower  he is at 5  I have a Loot Horder  so if rag hits the horder or my face  i win  He snipes the creeper  meaning i lose to his todecked Fiery War Axe  Thanks for a game balance where wasting cards is rewarded and taking reasonable risks is severely punished  blizzard\", \"commentId\": \"25650\", \"commentDate\": \"1473433740\"}, {\"comment\": \"That last sentence was
