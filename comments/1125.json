definition of cancer  Its pretty simple  These players dont want to make an effort  they want their wins the easiest way possible and as a consequence  they ruin the experience for a lot of players who want a challenge and doesnt want to get autosteamrolled  eight people on my friendslist have quit the game in the last 4 months because of this  This is not a winners mentality  a winners mentality is to win by defying the odds  not by getting the win handed to them  Lets say I like playing golf and Im good at it  I come up against someone less experienced than me and naturally  we adjust the handicap so we can get a fair match  enjoyable for everyone  Then how come 90 of the hearthstone playerbase are playing with a handicap of 40  and noone agreed to a handicap in the first place This is the first and only game IVe ever experienced  that rewards you for being lazy  and for lacking any sense of creativity  A game is something you should work on getting good at over time  not be rewarded for choosing the easy way out  So yeah  I truly regard these players as the real cancer  They add absolutely nothing to the growth and innovation of the game  They simply jump to the frontpage of this site  or to a known streamers twitch channel  copy the easiesttopilothighest winrate deck and go autoplay  so they can feel good about themselves  If this was a practice in any other type of competitive game or sport  they would be laughed in the face\", \"commentId\": \"23503\", \"commentDate\": \"1470111892\"}, {\"comment\": \"how is dragon warrior even beatable   best removal

not picked solely on your rank or win streak  Im busy playing a strange homebrew ramp Druid taunt deck on ladder and the match making system is giving me matching decks to play against  Yesterday I played a mid range nzoth  hunter and I was flooded with shamans and other hunters  change decks and suddenly very few  tons of otk warrior  CThun Druids  and even some decks running my weird cards like the 45 6 mana heal for 2  seriously suboptimal   run one and boom  meet another within 3 games  Seriously  pick 5 cards you think people never play  ice rager  Cho  etc  put em in a deck and youll start seeing strange decks and mirror matches  Matchmaking is most definitely rigged  my theory is its designed to favour current expansion cards  and decrease the effectiveness of older cards  to increase sales of new packs  In before pure salt tin foil hat doesnt makes sense      its quite possible to test play 100 consecutive games alternating between two wildly different decks    one onmeta mid or fast   the other off meta and slow control  and track the deck types you face  I guarantee they will be markedly different between the two types of deck you run  Match making looks nonrandom and rigged based on your deck   I think it encourages people to play current decks  Que the blizzard bots and shills trying to argue  fuck your arguments  come with data or fuck off\",
