you run  you just need to play at tempo  I like that this makes the game cheap and accessible to new players  After all this guy had clearly not been playing the game too long    Whats frankly stupid though is that basically ability as a deck builder only counts if you are trying to play mid range  slow and combo decks   Deck building should matter whatever play style you have   and fast decks shouldnt automatically be good\", \"commentId\": \"26916\", \"commentDate\": \"1476275765\"}, {\"comment\": \"At rank 11 now using some kind of tempo mage   Funny how RNG is everything in this lottery
