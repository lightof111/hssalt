faced so dumb and weak decks  even at 23 wins  but all my opponents have perfectly competitive tier 1 Jade Druids Sure game  that was fair and fun  For a strange fucking reason I have a feeling that the moment I went with Miracle Rogue  I would suddenly face only aggro Warriors      Edit back to arena  11 with a shitty Warlock  opponent Hunter misses lethal  plays 3 legendaries  just the usual I
