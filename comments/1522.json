"[{\"comment\": \"Nope  it wont end until they nerf the shit out of it   Thats because there are too many loser assholes that cant think for themsleves and make a noncancer deck   Just concede instantly or rope them   Its disgusting and is making the game almost unplayable   Fucking sucks  Id also like to mention how UNDERcosted HEX is   Fuck that card   3 mana for a deathrattle killing  instataneous killruin of a strong minion  Every other class with such a card pays dearly for it   Polymorph is 4 mana and even thats kind of cheap for its effect  Fuck Shaman   Most horrible class ever  Do these assholes enjoy playing that deck  Its 100 brainless  ZERO thought   ZERO decisions   Its really retardproof   Guess thats good so the tards can win too  \", \"commentId\": \"31961\",

seems off to me  Polymorph feels much more like a tech card  hex feels more like an autoinclude if you are not building a faceaggroshaman deck  Funnily enough Im nowadays less worried by Hex because a most shaman decks are just aggro or midrange heavily on the aggro side of midrange and dont run it b this superrestrictive meta makes running hex targets good deathrattlers  like Sylvanas or Cairne not viable anyway\", \"commentId\": \"31968\", \"commentDate\": \"1486344271\"}, {\"comment\": \"I would dare say that I would rather deal withMysterious Challenger than face yet another Shaman Deck

Shaman in the past year  Because I would mock the inevitably idiotic rambling as they try to answer it   I mean  they kind of answered Paladin healing to play a very long  controlling game  or a more aggressive build with small guys to be buffed   Now  they completely failed to make either of those viable  but at least there was an idea   Shamans design was literally Just play your cards   Theyre
