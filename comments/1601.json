since Ive hit rank 5 with three of my own homebrews so far  What I dont understand is how some of these other decks that hit front page get so many upvotes  particularly when theyre either completely unoriginal  have no guide  andor have no rank attached to them  Like I get it  if you made Legend with a deck  itll get upvotes  If you created an interesting an original deck that has a good guide  you deserve upvotes  But when you have none of those three And youre asking for upvotes for a guide youll never give I thought there was some new rule on Hearthpwn that prohibited people from asking

flying across  I missed that turn and managed to drop something the next turn  but clearly it was too late by then  He proceeded to spam Thanks to every move from then on    After the match I friend
