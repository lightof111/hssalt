enjoyment of pack opening and card collecting and holding out hope that someday itll live up to its potential\", \"commentId\": \"24589\", \"commentDate\": \"1471929576\"}, {\"comment\": \"The best thing I did was quit the game two days ago  However  I felt I should give a thoughtful farewell to the certain decks  classes and cards that I have so enjoyed playing against every single day for the past year  PRIESTS  Go fuck yourselves  Youre the most hated class in Hearthstone because you suck hobo dick  Nobody likes playing against you and there is a good reason Thats right I mentioned it its because you suck hobo dick  You buckets of donkey jizz should be demanding Blizzard give you some cool minions in place of your 67 ways of using ours  But instead  youre lazy and stupid so you steal other peoples shit and buff a fucking cleric every turn  I think the only reason this class exists is because Ben Brode has the intellect of a fucking hubcap  MILL ROGUE  It takes a special kind of scumbag prick to play this deck  The kind you want to wrap up in copper wire so you can jack the son of a bitch to a transformer until it smells like burnt toast  Only a subtroll loser sack of cunts would enjoy playing this deck  If you play Mill Rogue  youre part of the fucking reason this game is unbearable  Im sure youre unbearable as well  sitting on your fat  sweaty asshole and stuffing your piehole with Twinkies  FREEZE MAGE  Yeah we get it  You keep claiming this is some thoughtprovoking deck but its really just a predictable  boring lump of hard dog shit  You know it and so does everyone else  Youre so uninspiring I find it hard to insult you in creative ways  Nah  just kidding  Youre as useful as a wet firecracker and your mother pays her rent on the street corner  Probably got picked on at school for dressing like the Morton Salt girl and using three inches of makeup you fucking pussies  HUNTERS  Youre just dumb  Period  I could argue youre beyond dumb but how much dumber can dumb be Hey  if youre a golden Hunter  good for you  What you basically did is the equivalent of counting one to ten in a quantum physics class  If you put any more effort in  we might have to award you your Tonka toy next week  Keep up the good work and maybe someday youll finish a fucking book  CTHUN  This shit wore out after the first ten days and if youre still playing CThun decks then simply sit on a campfire with a gasolinesoaked ass  Hearing those cunty minions say the same fucking shit repeatedly makes me want to cram my mobile device up your fucking nostril and kick your balls until their melted Dairy Queen  Holy fuck is this game stale  YOGG  If you happen to be someone who enjoys playing Yogg  I would happen to enjoy watching velocity tests involving you  a human slingshot and a brick wall  Most of you maggots just vomit spells with no regard hoping to see your 10 minute animation so you can jack off at night over a coin toss win  Worst card in the game  A game full of cunts  Im glad Im out\", \"commentId\": \"24590\", \"commentDate\": \"1471929879\"}, {\"comment\": \"With Barnes blizzard created a Tuskarr Totemic for all classes     cant we have some
