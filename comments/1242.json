amHahahah  nice try  but 2 more spellpower totems rolled  activating his spirit claws and lightning storm for perfect board clear  then second tuskarr rolled him a totem golem  Just gotta love how the game teases you that maybe  MAYBE you wont be the unluckiest player for one day but no  Cant wait what else luck has in store  second game with barnes into highmane so far  besides the perfect hunter curve no  its not the Yshaarj version  Edit 9 games later  I only won 1  It is literally the best way scenarious for all of my opponents every fucking game  Perfectly filling all the mana with exact answers  emptying their hand on turn 4  then proceeding into perfect topdeck mode  RNG is rigged against me  theres is no other explanation at this point  I dare to challenge anyone among the so called millions of players who is more unlucky than me  because there is no one  As I said earlier  its not statistically possible to continuously lose 70 of the RNG rolls for months  Another 2 games lost to 5050s  I love how I have some people on friendlist who said they were unlucky  then started spectating me and said that this is impossible \", \"commentId\": \"26052\", \"commentDate\":

once did I draw into my brawl  Everytime I stabilised  they always topdeck into exact lethal  All of the Dargon Warriors got Hunter Hero Power when they needed it the most and all of them topdecked lethal from life tap  All of the tempo mages got perfect rng from flamewakers and made so many misplays by fireballing my face but still not punished for topdecking burn spells  I am yet to see a
