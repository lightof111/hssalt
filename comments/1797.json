the old arena back  seriously  Wether you draft an OP deck or you are fucked as practically everyone with more than some wins has an OP deck  Now you lose against players that clearly have no clue of arena simply because their deck is so fucking strong  Before you could get at least 8 wins with a pretty bad deck simply because you are playing better  This is no lomnger possible these days  Even though I like the standard arena the new drafting sucks  Why did Hearthstone become such a bad game  WHY MAN I FUCKING LOVED THIS GAME  I went totally crazy in arena and spent so much time  Fucked up

environment so toxic Wantto get high wins pick mage  rogue or paladin Learning to be good at arena is how i got my collection in Hearthstone Now i dont see myself getting too much gold for the next expansion I had 5000 when UNGORO hit I had about 1000 left after   Now I am at 600 Please tweet PlayHearthstone so they know the state of arena and do something about it\", \"commentId\": \"37682\",

time mark in your post  Its true that arena filled up mostly with mage  paladin and rogue class  Because the other classes suck badly   As for me  today i also attended to arena  Guess what On my choosing hero phase i got priest  druid and shaman  Dafuq I wanted mage too So next 8 games i faced priest and paladin only once  other were mages  Fucking 6 times of 8  Mages  With primordial glyph

only two cards that can destroy them  and adding them to a deck makes that deck weaker against 8 other decks in the current meta  Which makes it even worse when they can drop 055 for nothing and completely wipe out your board  or turn your big minions to sheep  Oh you got the coin  fantasic its the only safe thing to throw and pop a secret  because if you lose to a single counter spell your whole plan goes to the garbage  Yeah play around the secrets  but its so tiring  Secrets destroy the momentum of the game  Mirror matches are even worse  You know who wins  Whoever has the chance to play more then one ice block   Oh and screw medivhs valet and secret draw  Are you kidding me  Valets a frost bolt and secret explorer draws one of their important cards  and they have a solid body  I
