\"I cant afford to get Gadgetzan cards at all  I have a handful of them from free packs  but thats nothing  Ranking in standard is now impossible without them  I can feel myself falling more and more behind now because of Blizzards methods of expansion releases and card acquisition  Fuck you Blizzard  you greedy assholes  Make it easier to get cards  Paying 300 dollars to get each card in an expansion is anticonsumer and so is the pitiful rate of gold and dust gain in this game  This is a digital card game  not physical  Use a business model that suits a digital game  you pricks  This whole formats thing is retarded and everyone who supported it as being better for newer players are idiots  If you dont have lots of disposable income  you will get quickly left behind as new expansions are constantly churned out  I wish this game was pay to play where you get most or all of the content up front instead of this greedy pay to win nonsense  And it is pay to win  If you want to have any chance of winning consistently in standard ranked or even wild now beyond 20  you have to have new cards  It will always be this way  Blizzard are leeches and you people that encourage these practices are willing victims of their bloodsucking ways  rant\", \"commentId\": \"31168\", \"commentDate\": \"1484774119\"}, {\"comment\": \"I was temporarily banned due to warningsinfraction

experiences you are having when playing against the Druid class  specially about Jade Lotus Druid  In order to give our Hearthstone player base the best game experience we can  we will automatically match your reno YShaarj wild hunter with all the Jade Druids existing in wild format right now  Because fuck you    Id fucking ban that class from any game I could play  even with decks theoretically favored versus those morbid fartsnorters  They are the biggest reason part of me wants Malfurion to fucking die in Legion  although most surely will go to sleep again  as he always does after standing on foot for more than 20 minutes  Im bored to death of them  And the fact new standard meta is no way going to severely cripple them oh  cool  you lost Living Roots and Raven Idol  how tragic    well  lets just say Im seriously starting to think of joining the pirate side just to release the hatred I have for that retarded piles of dog vomit  I have a dream  That one day  we will have a meta where druid is nothing  And that day  the world will be better  because druids will stop encouraging aggro infestation  nor infestate the meta with aggros themselves  And that day  maybe control  aggro and midrange will find the balance  Maybe that day  when the name of Malfurion Stormrage is just a bad dream  Hearthstone will be a less salty game  a more friendly game  Maybe that day\", \"commentId\":

Priest  The standard decks are everywhere and nothing else can climb  starting from rank 20  Its boring and unimaginative  Im so tired of trogs  patches  Kazfukus  Reno  Abysal enforcer  drakonid  etc etc  all the decks seem the same and they are all way too efficient to compete against with something different  It just seems that it couldnt be any clearer that Blizzard wants a game where your long term card collection is irrelevant unless you have purchased the cards to play current expansion cancer  Its fucking horrible to be honest  I have hundreds of great cards most of which are irrelevant or unplayable   This makes the game unsatisfying if you are creative with deck building  and getting emote bullshitfuckery from people playing generic decks sucks balls when you cant autosquelch  it
