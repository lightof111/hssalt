Jade literally always I tried my Goons Pally which has literally everything a Goons Pally would need  Wickerflame  Eadric  Sally  All the Synergies  Card Draw  Removal  Hell even Meanstreet Marshal and Informants to deal with situations that werent ideal I struggled so hard against that Jade Druid  I got him down to 2 health  and then he won  While you might say Congrats You got really close with a dead archetype Its terrible because said dead archetype should techincally tech against this and always win based on rock paper scissors  I mean I was trashing those Jades left and right I had that druid up to 1313 Golems with 2 cards in hand and all auctioneers dead  But no  Not even the archetype that was made to stop it couldnt stop it  And that deck is expensive AF too  Im just glad I managed to get everything from packs  This is BS  EDIT Heres the deck im currently experimenting with  Im not some deck architect or anything and some cards have better options  but even so a deck with this strong a synergy shouldnt lose to a deck it should naturally beat  and Pally is already the strongest Goons variation         MIdGoons Control Pally \\r                     Unknown Deck \\r
