but if you cannot find your sheeps  Frostbolts  Hexes and Equality in time  you simply loose  If they have one minion on board  you can die  Its like playing against the old Combo Druid FONSR  just with the difference  that this combo can come out by any turn  If they buff up a minion once  you need to remove it immediatly  If you play a minion with 2 or less attack  you cannot play another minion as well  because they will use it against you  I dont know but out of all classes  this type of playsytle is the most annoying  because there next to nothing you can do if you dont find your answers to the exact time you need them  which is needless to say isnt managable on a consistant basis\", \"commentId\": \"38639\", \"commentDate\": \"1497179613\"}, {\"comment\": \"Once again the
