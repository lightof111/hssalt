prewotog  even played some first days aggro shaman  Although I somehow agree with your sentiment partly  its because of different reasons  Every fucking person plays either shaman or hunter  it s getting to the point right now at rank 10  that the game is again a repetetive boredom  Shamans are easily beatable nowadays  its just soooo boring  But the part where you talk about spending money  you re just being laughing stock  You even contradict yourself  You want to promote intelligence  but the moment you spend money you should be ahead of others So basically you re all in favor of
