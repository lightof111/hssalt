warrior or rogue  I pick warrior  Faced a lot of miracle rogues lately so I techd my deck a bit to make the matchup better  As usual  Blizzards rigged matchmaking takes effect and none of those are there to be found  Instead  I face reno mage  I put quite a bit of thought into the matchup  so Im quite positive Dude plays Kazakus on t4 like a complete dumbass so my hopes go up a bit more  What sucks  however  is that I cut weapon removal from the deck  Im a bit behind  get shit draws like acolytes and some other draw that I really really dont wanna play in the matchup  to make it worse  I play no Elise in the deck to make them useful in the late game at least  But okay  Dude plays Thaurissan into Medivh and thats where shit starts going down He Blizzards my board  gets some dopeass minion but okay  I can deal with that  In a few turns  hopefully  My minion gets killed by Portal and 56 spawns  Great  I start losing armor due to lack of my removal or any useful cards  for the matter  its somewhere on the botton of the deck  Next turn he 9 mana Pyroblasts my face which gets him Malygos  Proceeds to 1 mana 8 dmg frostbolt for exact lethal  Must be karma for my 210 winstreak

become so annoyedfrustrated with Ranked that they stop playing or play less there  I havent played Ranked since middecember except for cardbacks  and I dont care about rewards anymore And with no where else to go Casual is the only option left    At its core  I still like Hearthstone  as long as its just for fun  But all this aggroface stuff makes playing this game a chore  At least in Casual I can play more relaxed and just quit and move to the next game without consequences\", \"commentId\": \"31744\", \"commentDate\": \"1485873352\"}, {\"comment\": \"well  if Casual and Ranked are the same and you dont care about rewards anymore  you can treat Ranked as Casual    at least Ranked wins go towards Golden Heroes  I mean  you can always quit and move on to the next game in Ranked

already have a golden portrait of the heroes I want  Been playing since beta  only need Rogue and Paladin and I cant get into those classes I just dont want to go through the hassle anymore of ranking

changes to Ranked and adds in some new interesting incentives and balancing the current meta would be ideal as well Id definitely consider going back  But it should be a fun experience  and not making me feel stressed  which Ranked currently does\", \"commentId\": \"31746\", \"commentDate\": \"1485881156\"}, {\"comment\": \"Hmm  Good point  Well  I guess if youre enjoying it more than ranked  good for you  And indeed  I know that ranked makes me feel stressed and salty     Wish I had 7 Golden Portraits      only have 4 Paladin  Warlock  Rogue  Hunter  Also been playing since beta but I only started playing serious ranked in Nov 2015  which is why even though I have 8k total wins  I have only 4 goldens which is why I ended up regretting it at some point\", \"commentId\": \"31747\",
