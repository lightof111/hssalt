seen Dr 8  so every win required me to think  evolve shaman I had the quest of shaman  so lets play the least annoying one I can actually craft and CThun priest  And all of them met these sort of shit with pretty bad results  The thing is  I play something with few card draw  I get punished by getting crap hands I have to recover from  Other people play few to no draws at all  I get punished by having to deal with the most amazing curve they could have thanks to not putting any card draw in the deck not even Elekk  wich is a very nice oncurve draw  And also  now I remember  fuck those Yogg hunters  I can live with midrange  zoo  and even some kinds of shaman  but these guys They can go and eat goat shit for breakfast\", \"commentId\": \"22389\", \"commentDate\": \"1467709383\"},
