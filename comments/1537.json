for me is that midrange decks are completely worthless right now   They get run over by fuckface aggro and of course dont have firepower to kill asshole Reno decks either   Im soooooooo fucking tired of Reno  sooooooooooo tired of them always having it   Warlokcs especially   That renolock deck takes ZERO fucking skill   You just keep the board clear which you have several ways to do    There is NO penalty for making a reno deck when youre a fucking warlock because you always draw the fucking guy right on time    Warlocks have too many board clears and too many other ways to stall  keep the bard clean      there isnt a god damned thing you can fucking do   Except play pirate decks which I refuse to do  Somebody has to fix this fucking game  Please   help us\", \"commentId\": \"32278\",
