interactions  You dont have taunt Opponent will disregard board and go face unless they are FORCED to interact with the taunt  Like  why not just have a single player game then if you NEVER interact with your opponents Play card  go face   Like  everyone just goes face  then sends me angry messages when they lose Like     seriously I win 1MAYBE 2 out of 30 games AKA the coin flip  Why you crying   Better players arent even technically better  They just play more  thats all they do  You play 10 games  with 4 wins  they play 20 games with 8 wins  Same     Just more and more games to counteract

now on reddit Best meta ever for ranked  Guess what  Less burst  More control decks  So keep it up  idiots  and remove cards like fireball  frostbolt  evisecrate  kill command etc  More expensive ones like Firelands are probably fine  but enough is enough with this crap  Fireball is way too flexible of a card Or just print some god damn counters to spell  It doesnt take a genius to do that instead
