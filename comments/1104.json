And that does happen once or twice it happens EVERY TIME A good example would be a game I just played  I was a Cthun Warrior against a Tempo Mage    Tempo mage plays antonidas and flamewalker on empty board  hand is brawl  ghoul  map  a shieldbearerand I also had a fiery win axe equiped with 1 durability  so without execute or shield slam I played ghoul and brawled13 for antonidas to live if flamewaker survived I could kill it with win axe  if it survived  if ghoul survived i could be lucky for once    Guess what Antonidas survived  Then in the following turns draws were like slam into

Flamewaker  Tunnel Trogg  Frothing Berserker and CThun They have some more or less balanced minions with infinity side  like Lowly Squire  Recruiter  Unbound Elemental  Even NexusChampion Saraad is quite fine    Hate cheap  but great buffs with downside Power Overwhelming   cuz of modern state of game with lot of ways to generate tokens    Hate Divine Favor   when it draws more than 3 cards    I want cap of effects for cards Example  game vs Chtunpriest  i was with hand like reno  aldor  equality  tirion  golden monkey and forbidden healing3 cards in deck and i have some dudeboard presence  He had 2 cards  next turn  fatique  CthunDoomcaller Cthun  salt eh  i should not kill his Cthun  only aldor was fine play  but Doomcaller was unexpected  I thought his last card was entomb  not DoomcallerOr games vs tempo mages  where they got dream start on wyrms  sorceress and cheap spells and my cards are passive minions wo charge  weak spells  no weapons and so on  and im dead on turn 56  despite that i played my minions turn 25    He can remove them for almost free and buff up wyrms Or  when that failed  something like this can happen  Conjurer into Tome  than flamewaker into shitload of spells And etc\", \"commentId\": \"23056\", \"commentDate\": \"1469294285\"}, {\"comment\": \"Flamewaker is no where near infinity what are you talking about It is only activated by the
