on earth but I seem to become more and more retarded as time passes  Before WoG I was able to at least reach rank 15 each season to get a rare but this month  the max I got was rank 17  right after that I lost all my stars and went back to rank 20  Tonight was definitely the worst though  I played something like 20 matches and won only 1 and only because I had crazy topdecks  I even lost against BASIC DECKS  The worst was against a mage  He had a disconnect that made him skip two turns  AND YET HE WAS ABLE TO COME BACK AND FUCK MY ASS  This game is definitely too complicated for me  I am currently considering uninstalling  EDIT I started playing with the basic priest deck in order to eliminate one parameter my retardation might influence  I hope I will have more success with this

\"after 3 days of trying to do my 3 win Druid quest  Im still at 03  not even damn tavern brawl could do it  because I faced warriors with their legendary guy that puts down 3 minions for free  now I had almost won a game I thought  I had a great start and curve  but the deck is  with fking Yogg  and all Yogg did is buff and even divine shield the enemy minionsYogg fkss me all the time how can anyone win games with that shitty card of course I only use it when Im behind but its never useful  damn crapand now I decided to cancel that shitty druid quest and get to play warlock  because it stacks with another quest I queue up against a druid and he instantly concedes\", \"commentId\": \"21818\", \"commentDate\": \"1466477695\"}, {\"comment\": \"So im gonna express something ive been saying lately  ive stated in the past that Casual mode is ment to be nonTryhards and people who dont want to take it seriously  So ive been trying to rank up and its been somewhat fun  Im not aiming for legend and its just for fun and testing my skills im around ranked 12 at the moment and im working to get to my 500 wins with Warrior  im around 414  Now i could be a piece of shit who farms around ranked 2015  So i was playing Ranked today and first game i played was against a Sjow CW  the exact list  the next game I played was against Znoth Paladin  a Cliche List list with Kodos and every card i see in every typical 30 card list  The last person I played against was Shaman  oh boy So ive come to hate shaman  do i hate it as a class No  I think Shaman as a Whole is a fun class to play and there is nothing wrong with that  But the current shaman list i see most often is things with FlameJuggler and other cards i see most often  Whats annoying is Shaman is too powerful because if they go turn 1 tunnel Trogg into turn 2 totem golem  they have a 90 of winning that game  And of course turn 5 doomhammer comes about and im just saying Ooze please and i never draw it   So i lost because i didnt have what it took to take back the board  and of course he Emotes Well played which just set me off  now i admit im an asshole at the moment and i was being salty and adding him just to vent   So i was being a dick in saying hey MLG pro  im sure you must get alot of chicks with the Skill you have at ranked 12 with the most Cliche Shaman list he replies by saying  im not the one playing the shitty warrior deck  i play what wins and i replied by stating   id rather lose to someone who isnt a completely insecure and that big of a  tool  Good job MLG pro  and thats where the chat ended  like i said    i admit i was being salty  but i think this is where it shows people alot of character when it comes to showing who a person really is  Hearthstone is a Videogame at heart and its meant to be taken as something where you escape and have fun  I think it says alot about someone who in one breath shits on someone for being original  but then doesnt have the courage to build someone for themselves  Now look  I get people have a mindset where  they want to do something that will help them win  clearing im not gonna put nat peagle in CW  even tho that would be fun but dont shit on someone who is trying to be cleave and doesnt have success at first  As Reynad would say  you are being to result oriented if you want to shit on someone for their deck building  Thats why I would Rather watch a Streamer build something that they have created themselves than have them play a cliche netdeck  The people playing Shaman right now are probably the same douchebags who were playing Secret paladin and before that it was Grim Patron and then Face hunter and when the next set cards comes out it will be the same Toolbox coming out  All im saying as a whole is  you are taking this game way to Seriously if you are playing the most Cliche Midranged shaman at ranked 12 on June 20th  youre not gonna get legend dude  i promise\", \"commentId\": \"21819\",
