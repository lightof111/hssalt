myself here  guys Complaints are ok but how  and i repeat  how can nobody talk about the malygos plague infesting the ladderFor you  Its a shame playing an aggro deck i can understand that by some pov

warrior ones for sure   the matchmaking system is a fucking joke as well and nobody can convince me otherwise   and to the person who is nagging about malygos a few posts above simply NO     dying at

like vs this murloc paladin deck  its too fast and efficient   I am starting to wonder why nobody is playing this on ranked  then I remembered that most of the HS fanbase are a bunch of copycats and
