like a wasted evening  Playing freeze mage to prey on the rogues and ended up losing a few times to bad RNG  First game I have lethal and he gets Iceblock from swashbuckler  literally the only spell in my deck that could have saved him I also played around counterspell  He is then able to win off of this RNG  complete bs  Second game I have antonidas on the field with his field frozen  I need anotonidas to live to be able to get the required burn to win and the rogue literally has 0 cards in hand  He then top decks hallucination obviously  I think the only three cards he could possibly get are polymorph  forbidden flame or Iceblock that would save him fireball not enough as face tank damage loses him the game  Of course  he gets forbidden flame and then wins   Third game Im against a priest and Alex is  I shit you not  the last card in my deck  At this point Im just a salty  raging beast  The priest was nice enough to add me and apologise for my bad luck though  That was the end of my evening for ranked though  the luck involved in this game can be absolutely infuriating at times  Sad times\", \"commentId\": \"36165\", \"commentDate\": \"1493296904\"}, {\"comment\": \"Was 1

every match they play Its because they get piad by Blizzard to promote the game for them and give players an unobtainable bar at which to aim for  while the rest of the scrubs muck it out hardly getting a win  Its all so clear now     Unless of course  they only pick the games they win to show on Youtube to pretend they are better than they are    but thats jsut silly    o O\", \"commentId\":

a certain level onwards there is no skill involved in HS  Sure  there might be people who flamestrike a 11 minion but you dont see them to often on ladder  Concerning decision making  I have seen it so many times that Progamers were opting for the wrong move because they talked themselves into it  Sometimes it works out because the scenario they dream up will occur but the arguement that they are playing the odds just means that they are gambling and in gambling you usually dont walk away ahead\", \"commentId\": \"36175\", \"commentDate\": \"1493300170\"}, {\"comment\": \"Tavern brawl  kid
