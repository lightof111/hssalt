free packs from the quests  so i had to go with Zoo and to my surprise it was extremely successful against Jade Druids  On the other hand  it became impossible to win against Renolock  Im saying this in comparison to previous versions of Renolock  I may be wrong or my zoo deck may be outdated without some new cards  but thats my impression  Guess ill have to make 100g per day to catch up\",

assumed it was ice block  There was no possible secret that wouldve made trading before testing a better play  so it was once again 100 a misplay  Guess what The shaman won  This is why Ive lost my
