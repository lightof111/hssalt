beyond me   Example  just played a Purify Priest who buffed the heath of a razor leaf to 18  I was waiting on the one turn kill  and then he purifies it WTF I mean it wasnt a one turn mistake that we all do on occasion  he buffed that card for a few turns which means  he had no clue on the purify mechanics   GET OFF MY LADDER LOL\", \"commentId\": \"37694\", \"commentDate\": \"1495208922\"},
