why need people to get wins for their satisfaction i think they are just too stupid to have fun with other decks  so if they cant have fun with building own decks or trying out new stuff  they stick to the OPshit  this is what bothers me  because blizz provides the cards for those OPdecks  i think this tryhardattitude that most people have is ruining the fun in this game  i get the competitiveaspect  but cmon  theres nothing special in sticking with decks that are that strong and forgiving  its a illusion if you think youre good when you get the wins with that decks  if you wanna prove that youre a smartass  go arena and get an average winrate of 7  just my two cents here  over and out\", \"commentId\": \"27705\", \"commentDate\": \"1478567942\"}, {\"comment\": \"You

they are incredibly bad at playing the deck and probably dont rank up much  but it takes a special kind of asshole to do this in casual  Theres no point   Also  to the guy who was playing Discard
