team says gg outloud when they win the game and it happens every fucking time  so about 20 mins ago I played a game of overwatch where my team sucked ass because we lost in under 3 mins and yet 3 players from the enemy team instantly said gg  Now guys  idk what world we live in where if you a game of overwatch in less than 3 mins its a good game  Now i dont want to hear the  reply of their being good Sports  because thats bullshit and how do i know this because people ive played against ive won and lost to do this     when they win they said it  when they lose they dont  Now i know what cliche response im gonna hear  Thats just you being salty because in this day in age where if you lash out against anything you are deemed as being salty  Just to say that Videogames online are really easy to play nowadays and blizzards game are notorious for being easy to play for bad players IE Hearthstone and overwatch  Now dont get me wrong i am all for being a good sport when it comes to Close and fought out games  if i spend 15 mins on a game that has gone back and forth then yeah  its understandable   but too often its a normal event of if they win  they cant say it fast enough  its hard to understand from my point of view at first but its just a sign of being full of ones Self if i win a game i dont even say anything because considering i feel this way  i wouldnt want to be
