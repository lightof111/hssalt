not  then the Pyroblast from Babbling Book will win the game before you deal lethal for the third or fourth time   As sickening as it was being essentially the same deck for three years  at least

Rogues bounce cards before hes ready to use them  only to have him still complete his quest turn 6  prep the spell out  and take you down to 11 health on the same turn   Once again I ask when will something be done about this damn quest  Even when you do everything you can to throw a wrench into his plans  the Quest Rogue can still pull out a bunch of Bullshit and still win   I dont know what the official stats are  but it feels like I see this deck half the time I play   And before anybody says it  NO  I will not play a brainless aggro deck like Pirate Warrior or Aggro Druid   I enjoy playing decks where you actually have to think about your moves  and not just vomit and play   Blizzard needs to realize that Quest Rogue is a problem  and do something about it   Whether its change the quest requirements  change how charge works  or send some of those fucking cards to the hall of fame   I dont care  just do something\", \"commentId\": \"37210\", \"commentDate\": \"1494635424\"},

I do some trades  when they complete the quest and fill the board  I just have the feeling  as if I didnt do anything that game  The most frustrating experience for me was a few days ago  when I miserably lost due to my opponent playing Vanish  even though they made some serious and stupid missplays  Because they had cheap minions  they easily filled the board  while I was struggling to recover  I even posted it in this thread a few pages back I totally agree on what you say\", \"commentId\": \"37212\", \"commentDate\": \"1494637368\"}, {\"comment\": \"sunkeeper tarim is super fair
