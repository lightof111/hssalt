\"Against NZoth Paladin  you need to rush and try to finish them off as quick as possible  Its over as soon as he plays Tirion Fordring  then Ragnaros  Lightlord  Even if you clear  he still gets 53 weapon and use NZoth  the Corruptor to spawn them back  The deck lacks early game and depends on handcard draw  But if they survive till turn 6  they will pretty much win it  Priest is excellent against NZoth Paladin  Entomb both Tirion Fordring and Sylvanas Windrunner  giving them nothing Mage and Shaman can use spell on those cards and avoid it completely  NZoth  the Corruptor dont spawn if you use Polymorph  HexOther classes  you just have to rush them before its too late\", \"commentId\": \"21071\", \"commentDate\": \"1464857202\"}, {\"comment\": \"How can you win at this game when

crappy spells  or I delete my own minions  etc  but when the oppononent plays him   Same in general though  Everyone seems to get whatever they need in their hand  Priests always get the best stuff from their shades  If I play priest I get a crappy minion  They get Archmage  or Tirion  or an extra Sylvanas  because ofcourse    Another example I am winning against a warlock  He plays Elise  One

control rogue against NZoth pally  With patron the key has been indeed play aggresively and trying their truesilvers not to hit a berserker  and set up for a big punch shit like getting a monstrous berserker or Inner Raged Grommash while still holding board    things like that  as far as I have experienced  its easier to achieve than it looks  because they often will think they are safe at big ammounts of health and get greedy with their removal    and if they equality down your combos  you can always patron  although I have never met a situation where I needed it  And with the other deck I have seen them often  control rogue    well  said rogue is unpredictable  can put quite a lot of pressure  steal tirion with sylv or delay those deathrattles with sap  play NZoth after baiting Equalities  or also going full CThun trying to 1shot it  If you have Reno  pally has it hard to kill you unless you cant deal with Tirion and NZoth\", \"commentId\": \"21080\", \"commentDate\":
