right now    but at least have some manners and dont spam emotes before you get the BrokeBack combo out and win the game Doomhammer  one or two Rockbiter weapon  Lava burst  Honestly  nearly every

\"commentId\": \"21258\", \"commentDate\": \"1465236390\"}, {\"comment\": \"Im with you on the emotes  I think the only time its maybe appropriate to spam emotes is if your opponent has made an incredibly stupid misplay  but even then you should still remain silent  The best use of emotes is when your opponent has been BMing you all game  but you end up winning  then emote thanks or greetings at the very end  right before the victory screen  Thats usually the only time I actually emote in the first place  As for these YOLO decks  they are fun to play if you are OK with a low winrate  which is what you will have with the decks  Nobody really gets away with it  It is very hard to win with an allin Astral deck  even if you get the dream coin  innervate Astral  it seems both from experience playing the deck and against it your topdeck next turn is guaranteed to be either second Astral or innervate    A few streamers have played Astral decks that are less allin they have other means of ramp  not just Astral and a bunch of big minions  But youll never see them playing those decks at the end of the season while trying to place top 100  And calling them noskillallluck decks    well I could call a face Shaman the same  You drew the dream opening curve You have Doomhammer on turn 5 Whats this  double rockbiter Im dead already Theres no skill there either  It just so happens there are many ways of making decks that can never lose if the cards are drawn in a certain order  But the less consistent YOLO decks are more fun  because the wins are spectacular  not an aggressive beat down that looks identical every game\", \"commentId\": \"21259\", \"commentDate\": \"1465236803\"}, {\"comment\": \"Playing FreezeMaly Mage vs a weird mirangy Cthun warrior  Builds up his Cthun to 1010 by turn 10 has me down to 9 health  i pop my alex on him  got lethal in hand as he only has 21 HP with his low armor count   I have a secret up    he face swings my Alex with Gorehowl and uses a 0 mana execute to reduce himself to 13 HP which is fucking retarded considering I just did Alex after a Thaurissan turn  youd think hed be trying to maximize health  Next thing I know he drops Cthun into my secret   which was barrier not block  So basically he made a play that either he would win or he would 100 lose rather than doing the sensible thing and getting out of lethal range     This game rewarding a braindead fucktard once again\", \"commentId\": \"21260\", \"commentDate\": \"1465237346\"}, {\"comment\": \"FUCK AGGRO SHAMANS  Dont tell me this shit isnt op

buffedass Tunnel Trogg  AND YET THIS SON OF A BITCH STILL WON WITH NO CARD ADVANTAGE GROSS MISPLAYS despite the fact that I managed to counter every of his biggest threats but theres a point when things go too fast  this guy continued to pull damage out of his ass  Skillbiters  Lavaskill  Skilltongue  etc    I was forced to make shitty trades just to remain alive  Oh and dont forget the godlike RNG with Tuskarr Skillemic giving him Skilltongue twice  or his hero power giving him Skillclaw when I needed to trade  Wrath of skill when he had a spell to cast  etc    Blizzard plz nerf

my OP 1 drop cause yes Im starting to think Tunnel Trogg is broken     Now please allow me to introduce you to Totem Golem the 2 drop that doesnt die to any 2 mana removal    Oh no wait maybe you would like to meet my adorable wolves  cause my Flametongue Totem feels so lonely     Oh youre still alive How come Here  say hello to 10 Damage for just 6 mana     Still alive Worry not Lava Burst is here to end your suffering      I want to play Combo Decks MiracleFreeze and all I see are retarded aggro players     I mulliganed for Nzoth paladin and got an idiot playing Bubble next game was against Warrior and I thought Finally a normal Deck but no of course  it was stupid Pirate Warrior Next up is Hunter and its OP 6 and 8 drops     Standard format was supposed to slow down the meta but instead some genius thought that  giving Shaman unbalanced cards Zoo a super annoying 3 drop and leaving us with Cult Apothecary as only neutral healing I mean it can heal for 14 nobody would ever play Antique Healbot over this card was a good idea so right now we find ourselves in a meta at least for me more boring than Secret Paladin one     Even Patron at its prime had a horrible MU right now the best you can get against Shaman its 5050  and only if youre playing a Deck as retarded as it is     Well after this wall of text I feel a bit less salty but I suppose that if I queued into another game Id soon become as pissed as I was before so Im just gonna go play some stupid One Piece fighting game and pretend every enemy I hit are Shaman Zoo Hunter and Warriors players\",
