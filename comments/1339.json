or 6 to double PO but i was too shocked to even take a screenshot  Just a run before i lost to insane paladin deck and ended 3  2 as well  I would not say that arena is for bad players but i would say that it can be way more unfair that constructed sometimes  Ladder is boring for me right now but i dont want to participate in such bullshit again so i think i will wait till new expansion to enjoy HS again\", \"commentId\": \"28080\", \"commentDate\": \"1479569387\"}, {\"comment\": \"The game is in an ugly spot right now   If you even dare to try your own deck or a tier 34 deck you cant get any enjoyment out of the game because the net deck window lickers are littered all through ladder at every rank   Most games you can concede by turn 34 since the tard decks just spew their overpowered crap like clockwork   Trogg into golem into feral wolves    fucking see ya   Game over  Huntard with secrets is just as bad   If you get a decent minion of yours hit by stupid fucking freezing trap the game is over right there   The insane tempo loss can NOT be overcome   Its fucking obscene   Play around the secrets    we know   except you many times cant   Run secret eater or whatever its called  Hardly helps and the card is horrible stat wise if you dont get to play at the perfect time with a bunch of secrets up   Fail  May as well test in ranked   Who cares  anyways anymore  There is little or no skill in this game   Its simply playing an OP deck and getting the right matchups and of course drawing better cards   No skill to it   Good cards WIN  bad cards LOSE   Not fucking nuclear physics\", \"commentId\": \"28082\", \"commentDate\": \"1479575831\"}, {\"comment\": \"Why does warrior have so many removals whatever I play it just dies   Cheap removal the worst shit in

one thing he could do to win  He has 15 cards in his deck  two of them are doomguard and abusive sergant  in hand he has 2 card  he draws the imp plays it  plays doomguard and gets the abusive sergant  and that was the ONLY order he could have won that game cause he only had 7 mana    and that cost me a golden legendary JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZZZZZZZZZ   Ps  Could someone calculate the chance I belive it

now  Over the past few days Im hovering around a 510 win rate  down from rank 13 to rank 17  There is no reason I can think of that would explain this or cause it to make sense  I am using decks Ive consistently had good win rates with in the recent past  I simply cant win games  It doesnt matter what deck I play  who I am matched against  or what I draw    I am beginning to really believe that the random elements that are at the core of the game  card draw  card effects  etc  favor one player in any given match  and that they favor a player in runs  and you will be given a good run or a bad run depending on whether it is your turn \", \"commentId\": \"28090\", \"commentDate\": \"1479594719\"}, {\"comment\": \"I hate tempo mage more than i will ever hate shaman  the deck is so cancerous  RNG based and without skill needed  all they do is play their brocken ass low cost minion and then they go face  they dont give a shit about the board and wow here s 10 more damage from firelands portal and 8 from ragnaros The cancer they bring is unbelievably strong and there is no really any hard match up for them expecially if they roll high  Hope this archEtype NEVER sees other cards once flamewaker is gone in the graveyard they call wild mode for less skilled player to have some fun rolling high  I hope its player base NEVER finds another deck so strong and gets instantly back to rank 15 where it belongs   FUCKING TEMPO MAGES YOURE WORST SCUM THAN SHAMAN REALIZE THIS IDIOTS\", \"commentId\": \"28091\", \"commentDate\": \"1479594855\"}, {\"comment\": \"Im beginning to be convinced

think 3 turns ahead about your and opponents moves  Check for lethal at the beginning of each turn after turns 78  especially if youre playing a longer game and especially if youre playing a slower

the advice  but it doesnt seem to matter  Sure  there have been times Ive missed lethal  but quite frankly it seems to make no difference at all if Im thinking 3 moves ahead  I can do absolutely nothing differently and win 12 games in a row or lose 12 games in a row  and there is just absolutely no rhyme or reason to it  Hearthstone is 97 luck\", \"commentId\": \"28095\", \"commentDate\":
