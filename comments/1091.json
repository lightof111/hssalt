trying to discredit an evidencebased statical observation that the matchmaking looks rigged with whatan irrelevant observation regarding 5 probability and an incorrect calculation involving expected

trials was sufficiently different that if there truly was NO difference between the two situations ie if matchmaking was random  then such an odd result would be expected only 5 of the time  1 time if I repeated the process of playing 84 games 20 times    Using a 5 probability level as a test that there is statistical evidence of an effect is accepted internationally in the majority of peerreviewed

you will be facing nobody  because the one of the two player got to face a easy opponent it this logic  Blaming blizzard for rigged MM is so pure salt in huge amount that the Dead See seems clean next
