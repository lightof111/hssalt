that theyre playing it in casual  I actually just hit rank 5 with murloc paladin and it really isnt hard to do well with  it might be hard to master sure but not at all to do well with  The irony is that the people playing hard decks in casual because theyre too scared to play it on ranked always have a terrible rank  Kinda tells something doesnt it\", \"commentId\": \"27273\", \"commentDate\":

even though there should be an auto squelch button but i cant mute this shit  sorry but i cant see why i should accept this kind of behaviour from an unknown virgin fat kid on the internet its not about the win its the behaviour i had like 8 straight wins before this  i think they should protect players more from situations like this  i mean whoever was in my place would be pissed to and i bet thats what the virgin faggot my opponent wanted to achieve  so i think just fucking maybe blizzard could protect players better from this i mean when i start a game now and someone hovers and ropes all game even if i mute him i will still end up mad  anyone would  fuck this seriously i dont understand why so many virgin cunts play this game\", \"commentId\": \"27280\", \"commentDate\":

 First match get queued into a pally with consecrate  coghammer  kings and t1 minions  Get resoundly stomped while having no chance  Ok  fine  It happens  Game 2 against a rogue at 0  1  Keeping up fairly well  pressing and he is forced to remove lots of minions with a weapon ping leaving him at lowish health  Then he plays dr 7  Then he plays ragnaros  I calmly closed hearthstone  navigated to apps and uninstalled  Its just not worth my time to not only not enjoy playing a game  but to actually be annoyed by it  There was no skill in either of those matches  just a straight up rng fest and who had drafted well  Yes  thats arena but are you fucking kidding me Constructed meta is stale  Cba to climb  Made a few fun decks and got a few wins reno rogue  reno mage  spell dmg mage  cthun rogue but the trade off for fun is consistency  I dont think hearthstone can ever be a dynamic and interesting game it is just too heavily invested in random effects as one of the main features that physical card games cannot have but that is just too much when combined with the inherent randomness of a card game  Doesnt work for me\", \"commentId\": \"27282\", \"commentDate\": \"1477343936\"},

optimized to beat all the usual cancer shit like ShamanHuntard   Once I embraced that losses are simply bad matchups due to the sheeple mentality of the meta  my frsutrations went away   Mostly\",
