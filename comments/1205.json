new adventures and I rarely tend to play the aventures straight away as I usually have to save up gold but instead just tend to find out whats happening with new cards by playing and seeing whats popular   I quite like some of the cards Im up against including plenty of humourous ones such as babbling book but every now again you come across something obscenely powerful and you just think  How did this card make it through Just been encountering druids all daywith Managerie Warden copying Stranglethorn Tiger   Thats just insane  Im wondering what the community feedback on this card has been What annoys me more than the card itself is the fact that they would never ever in a million years make such a good card for certain other  weaker classes  While Blizzard are pushing the Beast thing hard for druid  the only thing they push to Priest is Watcher Priest Lul\", \"commentId\": \"25231\", \"commentDate\": \"1472823042\"}, {\"comment\": \"I rage hard every time I open this thread on

was against a watcher priest   It was a straight forward match  once he dropped watcher and statue Stuhtoo if you watch Thijs  I knew Id see a silence or a purify  so I just kept the board clear   If I didnt have such huge and buffed minions in mass quantities  I think it would have gone much worse  since you really cant afford to let them establish a board and the minions are huge and cheap  necessitating trades of 2for1 in the priests favor just to prevent the establishment of a board   Ultimately I had more threats than he could keep up with  but I can see how watcher priest MIGHT have worked if someone ignored the cant attack minions   Ultimately though  the imbalance between the decks was insane   Even with all that removal he hard a time keeping up with the minions beast druid pumps out   We both had decent curve it seemed like  only he had to constantly choose between removal or establishing board  and I was always able to play some removal and drop a cheap minion to buff or copy next turn if he didnt remove\", \"commentId\": \"25234\", \"commentDate\": \"1472823591\"}, {\"comment\": \"1  People playing Tier 1 netdecks in casual because Blizzard gives a strong

guys  look at the images blow an try to guess the score   Two wins  Why Well  2 golden Valeeras with legendary cardback is the first reason  Going second in all three lost games is another one  Just

dont know  I would have guessed anything in the range of 1 to 5 wins  You have so little good early game  1 very strong 1 drop mana wyrm is dependent on spells afterwards  one 2 mana removal and three playable 2 drops and only 2 decent 3drops  A great legendary doesnt help if you lose the game before turn 5  And with that early game it seems likely that you dont curve out very well in some of the games  And also in the 5 mana department you have a couple of subpar Arena cards  I mean a 5 mana 36 is just not enough to catch up  All in all  the result is not really unexpected\", \"commentId\":
