rogues are just as sick of Auctioneer as you are  We just have no other tools to work with unless we want to try running face pirates or burgle  We havent gotten the OP weapons that were the supposed

than one damage unless you count the conditional Dark Iron Skulker  Half of us didnt want the miracle crap given to us in MSoG either  I would just like to see Blizz give us some control tools so we can actually do something with our fun cards Gang Up  Shadowcaster  AnubArak  Beneath the Grounds\", \"commentId\": \"32947\", \"commentDate\": \"1488350534\"}, {\"comment\": \"I am so triggered  ALL

\"Yep  my problem with Reno is that he makes midrange decks unplayable and those happen to be my favorites to play  The Reno lovers always assume you are an aggro player when you complain about Reno but its simply not true  Midrange decks can not kill their opponent twice and thats whats required for Reno decks  The new kazakus card has made it even worse because it gives either mage or warlock yet another fucking board clear as if they dont have enough already  If they can get Brann out there as well    its basically time to concede because nownthey have TWO extra ways to fuck you over  Im so tired of that shit  Its UNfun  Its not fair at all  And it hardly stops aggro decks that run you over sooner than turn 6 if they even draw remotely well   Reno should cost 8 mana  And  there ought to be a neutral spell or minion that blocks your opponents next battlecry effect  That would be a reasonable counter and might come in handy against some other decks too  There is currently NO away to stop a battlecries effect and its bull shit\", \"commentId\": \"32952\", \"commentDate\": \"1488363707\"}, {\"comment\": \"MtG Duels is looking so good right now\", \"commentId\": \"32953\",

every single one of them  I didnt think this was possible  but it seems like my RNG just keeps on proving that nothing is imposbbile  I think the combined chance for not getting a good matchup for this many games is less than winning our lottery  The only reason Im not rank 18 is because I cant lose stars anymore at rank 15 Its like I lost 30 coin flips  and the rest is a mirror match and best  I keep seing face Warriors and face Shamans whenever I queue Rogue in  all of them run the exact prenerf list  its like they dont even care and they dont have to  I lost all of them due to insane RNG  some Miracle Rogues when I go Malygos Druid  and Jade Druids when I go Renolock  At least I used to beat the Druids with my Renolock  but they all highroll so much I cant even do that anymore  So why the hell am I again at the sort end of the stick every time This is fucking ridiculous  I cant fuckin come out of rank 15 0stars because I absolutely get destroyed by RNG  Pure Shrute thinks he is unlucky  which I dont doubt  but he would crush his computer with my luck\", \"commentId\": \"32959\", \"commentDate\": \"1488376535\"}, {\"comment\": \"Is it any good Gonna DL it now   This pirate

compare it to Hearthstone any more  I did a little back when HS was in Beta  since they have become very disparate   But it is getting about as close to the physical game as it could within reason  As is the case with MtG  it has a huge backdrop of mechanics and sets to learn  adjust to   In particular though  there arent basically 2 deck archetypes that jizzle over everything else and run off hand
