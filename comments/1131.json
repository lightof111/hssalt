shaman who told me my deck is shit and when I said his is cancer he said nah cthun warrior is cancer  I finally managed to fatigue an aggro shaman with mostly luck and the salt was so worth it  He was BMing so hard  just spamming emotes constantly but they stopped when Reno came down and gaining 20 armor in 1 turn while spamming greetings felt great  Also his little rant telling me to kill myself while seeing he was rank 20 was pretty great too  I wish I screenshoted it\", \"commentId\": \"23616\", \"commentDate\": \"1470348046\"}, {\"comment\": \"Whomever I just played in wild with your
