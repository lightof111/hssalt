post it  realized the entry was closed  Im too stupid    Well  so at least I didnt do that for litterally nothing  here goes    Echo  After you have played a card with Echo  put a copy of it in your hand that is discarded at the end of your turn       Clarification  Echo happens at the end of the spell resolving  so before any after you have cast a spell effect  It puts a copy of the spell  That has Echo too  of course  but that will be discarded at the end of your turn  so you can cast it an infinite number of times  Well  no  you couldnt  because  mana  and stuff  but you get the drift   but only for one turn  Theyre otherwise completely normal spells  Or minions  but I didnt make any minion  so  yeah     Thirst for Knowledge  No matter how many time you use it  is always 1 mana overcosted VS single draw cards  4 mana for 2 cards VS Arcane Intellect  6 mana for 3 cards VS Nourrish  8 mana for 4 cards VS Sprint   The no cost reduction part is because it would be too much of a combo with Sorcerers Apprentice  Could go haywire with Spell Synergy  but on that point  Im more of the opinion its spell synergies that are broken instead of spells themselves  Killing Spree  Can only be cast if your hero is currently exhausted  To prevent spell synergies from going too much haywire   and allows them to attack once more  but only a minion  The health part looks kinda out of place  but theres no way such a card would be played without a healing part  Do note that because you have to attack to use this card repeatedly  it cant be used solely as a heal  Would obviously only be viable if weapon buffs came back into rogue decks  which I wish they did thanks to a certain buffs reversal  Cries in rogue   Jade Giant  If you can get yourself overloaded for 8  you get a full board of Jade Golems  but thats all youll most likely be able to do  You can of course be a coward and only go for 6 or 7 overloaded mana crystals and just have 2 or 3 cheap golems  but wheres the fun in that  Go big or go home  I honestly dont play shaman so Im unsure how easy to do itd be  so might warrant to up the cost if only to prevent a full board of Jade Golems and then a 2 mana card that unlocks all your mana crystals\", \"commentId\": \"28199\", \"commentDate\": \"1479795568\"}, {\"comment\": \"Dudes  NO NO  NO NO  YOU ARE NOT GONNA MAKE IT TO BRANN  INTO AYA  INTO SHADOWCASTER  INTO

overload 2 putting you at 7 and then spawn 4 golems which along with feral would be a pretty strong board as you are one massive buffing the golems and then two you cleared their board almost completely and definitely with lightning storm  You could also then add any 1 overload card and full golem out followed up by one of the two overload unlock cards  For the three card synergy alone I think it is already pretty strong  But add another overload card and the unlock crystal card it seems insane\", \"commentId\": \"28201\", \"commentDate\": \"1479801006\"}, {\"comment\": \"FUck this
