You guys are opposites  its fine  and will just naturally happen   Now on one hand I think pirate warrior is slightly overtuned Why it appeals to Spikes But I wouldnt go as far as to call the guy immoral for finding his fun in winning thus being of the spike community  he probably played midrange shaman  secret pala  undertaker hunter  whatever  its fun to him  cant make everyone happy its fine As much as id say ignorant of the way some can feel I understand some can feel completely or utterly mistreated  as if they didnt even have a chance to begin with  And aggro decks can be genuine pushers of that feeling because sometimes timmyjohnny decks just poorly draw and get wrecked  The biggest problem with an aggro deck is theres no real bad draw  unless u draw 2 drops against an aggro player with 1s  And this is where i see that complication that some people can feel cheated  Regardless of that I understand why hes mad  But you dont make him feel compassionate for you by basically calling him evil from labeling him immoral  Its just ignorance of how some people can feel  Theres no doubt in my mind some people have felt crappy  aggro decks included  when my reno mage or priest curves out well  But it happens  and if they feel bad I understand  People just need to see that it happens on both ends from time to time in a card game\", \"commentId\": \"29055\", \"commentDate\":

Argus on t8     and still lost  Shure I got lucky with my draws  but that shouldnt be possible   I understand people who ask others not to play this deck  because it takes the fun away  I myself will just play standard mode and hope to find more interesting games there  It would be nice if blizzard implememted more than one competitive constructed mode\", \"commentId\": \"29057\", \"commentDate\":

combos and laughing their faces off you while you actually try to play the game  I cant see any other class being so constantly encouraged to blatantly ignore any possible interaction  management  planning ahead or anything else as druid dont even dare to ask for rogue  because rogue had 3 combos  one was destroyed with BF nerf  and the other two are being discouraged for entire expansions by setting aggro metas and not printing nearly any good card that helps them  in opposition to any other deck  Druid so far has been cheating out with treesex druid  face druid  semicombo druid  malydruid  yogg druid  CThun druid often it plays pretty much like a face deck  but using removal  and now jade druid and Kun druid    Better yet  as it is the most scumbag class of the entire game  is widely populated by scumbag brats whose only source of reasons to live seems to be annoying people with their shitty decks  And even better  of course  because it couldnt be any other way  these

Heroic Strike can easily counter taunts  Even Dragon Priest which runs 4 taunts still has trouble winning against pirate warriors  As for weapon removal cards such as Ooze and Harrison  by the time we draw them  its too late  What is a turn 5 Harrison going to do when you are on 5 Health and the pirate warrior has burst cards in their hand Absolutely nothing  thats all  As for an Ooze played on turn 2  pirate warrior still has 2 Arcanite Reapers and a Firey War Axe that can be buffed ridiculously hard with upgrade   Its just irrating that all pirates do is to go face without getting punished and win by turn 6  I dont know about people who play pirate warrior  but I prefer having my games go past turn 6 where all the plays are strategically made such as a tempo play rather than a one huge minion play and value trades actually affect the outcome of the game rather than going face from the get go and win with minimal skillthinking\", \"commentId\": \"29069\", \"commentDate\":
