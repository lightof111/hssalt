freakin much  no one should statistically be this unlucky like me  And more than likely no one is  I yet to find a streamer experiencing such heavy unluck spikes like I do every few days   If I got this delusional thing called skill in this shitty game that I could finish top 100 one season where I werent as unlucky as in the others  then why doesnt anyone else experience this same shit Meta is absolutely disgusting as it is  and a few days ago when I literally havent faced anything but shaman  zoo and hunter except 12 tempo or face warrior for about 5060 games  I decided to run an excel sheet for 3 days  recording 125 games in total To my surprise  it was a little more versitale than the period before mainly a LOT more warriors  lot of streamers played cthun warrior these days  but thats the only positive thing I can say although its still basically cancer everywhere  I played a variety of decks except shaman  and rotated them upon losses just for the sake of variety  The results I got 22 4 28 Warrior  12 cthun 9 tempo  4 control  2 tempo dragon  1 patron 20 25 Hunter  22 midrange  1 face  1 deathrattle  1 yoggnload19 2 24 Shaman  14 midrange  9 face  1 hallazeal16 8

2 nzothGames won 59 47 2  Obviously  had I played for example zoo only  it might have been better  but for one  its extremely boring  and secondly  the rest of the decks were competitive too  played often by others  The last 15 games losing streak alters this a lot as well  but theres no point in excluding as this shit happens every 3 days basically  Would be easy to assume that I tilt and thats why I lose a lot in a row  but no  I dont consider myself as good as some so called pros  but Im not making worse plays just because RNG fucks me  Im so unlucky everywhere else  not just this clownfiesta Some other conclusions I got from these games Out of the 28 warriors I faced  23 had the winaxe against me on turn 2 82   I died 3 times against zoos from at least 16hp and empty board leeroy  23PO  abusives In 17 13 6 games  heavy RNG altered the result  2 times in my  and 15  times in my opponents favor  Disregarding my unluck  it doesnt seem much  BUT the games kept counted here are the ones where a less than 34 chance of RNG element happened  AND it altered the final result of the game obviously we cant 100 determine if the leading player who got unlucky would have won without RNG against hisher favor  So what were these Ragnaros hitting the bestworst target  sylvanas stealing the bestworst target  ysera giving awakens first turn  elemental destruction hitting 5 on all 5hp minions  perfect arcane missiles or yogg of course  which had to be perfect to result me the loss  happened  obviously Still doesnt seem much This number didnt include topdecks and perfect curves  winaxes on turn 2  turn 2 88 edwins  perfect gadgetzan draws  turn 6 renos  flame juggler hits  etc   and I can assure you  almost every single cancer player had the perfect curve If you think about it  this is 14 of the games that were not just decided  but got turned around by sheer luck  which is extremely high in a game that is holding tournaments with really high prize pools  as if perfect curves and topdecks werent enough rng elements already  Id say that I got bad matchups  but that really didnt matter  With the luck I had to face  I could lose with control warrior against freeze mages easily  Im telling the cards my opponent needs in hand to get in a really good spot  and they always have it  Sometimes even spectators joined  and laughed  saying they cant believe how anyone can be this unlucky  Then again  Im not saying that some of these losses couldnt have been avoided by better plays  But the fact that Im stuck over rank 5 for days  when  in theory  I can finish top100 legends  then somethings not right in the long run  So  what the hell do I do when Forsen got nothing on me on this topic The question is rhetorical of course  while wondering why I havent I given up on this shitty game already  Hope you didnt read it  me losing my sanity is way more than enough\", \"commentId\": \"21555\", \"commentDate\": \"1465860403\"}, {\"comment\":
