for my deck  again   edit what the fuck   back to back worst matchups  just like before   edit 2 ok so happy ending  i won that second one   for the future  i think the key to beating the living mana turn is to completely ignore it if youre at a safe life total and instead just put down a big threat of your own so theyre forced to trade or if they have innervate savage roar  youre just dead anyways so dont worry about it   edit 3 3rd druid in a row at the rank 5 final boss   blizzard hates me   edit 4 won that one too  but that wasnt the final boss     4th druid in a row   edit 5 lost that one becaues i cant beat the absolute nuts   back to rank 10 for me   edit 6 rogue mirror  in which i get an absolutely abysmal mulligan   i just want fucking rank 5 so i can stop stressing over

who played me in casual  I politely asked why he plays such a deck in casual  He didnt really give an honest answer   typical  Playing alot in casual has made me conclude that its full of toxic players OR new players  After receiving constant bm from players  I feel literally like any emote is bm  but on the other hand  I desperately hope they aint bm emoting    so   I most often take offense to any emoting  which I feel bad for sometimes  Also  the decks used are the stereotypical mainstream decks  Just sooo boring  Not fun  not interactive either\", \"commentId\": \"37352\",
