to find a quest rogue counter    wtf blizzard  this is so ridiculous    they usually finish the quest by turn 4 or 5 and then you got maximum 2 turns to kill them before youre dead    only sucessful counter so far is pirate warrior    and if i have to play this cancer shit i might as well quit    purify priest sometimes works to some extent  so im probably gonna try to refine this deck    but srsly how did this quest get through internal testing the problem with this shit is there is literally NO counterplay at all  you can never in any possible way stop them from completing the quest  if they dont play like a complete retard    and taunts wont save you either because 55 charges just kill them and most of the time dont even die  bc most taunts are 4 attack or below    im starting to believe this is even worse than the pirate warrior cancer\", \"commentId\": \"34818\", \"commentDate\": \"1491599789\"}, {\"comment\": \"People who still play pirate warrior are just this ignorant
