perfect hand isnt enough  When even Lifecoach gets runover by aggro as Rogue  with many different builds at that  I think its a bit of an issue  I really just hate all this aggro and no cheap heals or taunts to fight back  I cant even afford to play any lategame in my deck because of it  Sludge Belcher used to be such a strong turn 5 play  but its gone\", \"commentId\": \"23724\", \"commentDate\":

55 costing 06 depending  77 4drop  Doom hammer for face or removal  TBV and hero power on its own can win a game if it sticks    Blizzard just fucked up the Shaman balance  EDIT  also I hate anyone who ropes unless they are roping Shaman which is laudable and civic duty  so if Lifecoach is losing to Shaman at least thats a silver lining  Fuck that guy for encouraging playing to rope   2nd EDIT  thinking of  Lifecoach roping Shaman    I want Shaman to lose  I want people to rope Shaman  But I hate people who rope  so Id also like Lifecoach to lose  I hate everyone in that match  Lol\",
