this way  but anyone ever get triggered by someone saying either gg or Well played after they win Clearly youre gonna say that its good sportmanship but lets be frank its not  My thoughts are the fact is that gamers are full of themselves and massive hypocrites when it comes to winning and losing  rarely do you see players say gg when they lose  Granted i dont ever say it either way because i dont feel the need to boast   let me print this picture for you      imagine youre playing a game of chess or youre playing a paper Card game and you lose to someone and the second the game ends they want to shake your hand  Imagine that when you play online  2 instances are like when a game of overwatch ends ONLY the enemy team that wins say gg BECAUSE they won  The same goes in hearthstone  when they

spell already in your deck which means it assumedly should have synergy and guaranteed usage   Since mage discovers a random spell  it could be a lot of things that arent great for you   However since the standard rotation there are fewer bad spells  so I think a balanced card would just be a 1 mana discount or a discount that turn only so picking a flame strike on turn 2 wont get you the discount

balancing things properly  If the top tier decks were all cards from old expansions sales of the new cards would be slow  So they make sure winrates are good but not out of hand good for decks based around the new cards  Then they wave around stats saying look 5055 winrates for the topdecks  but its all manipulated bullshit  You can try it for yourself  pick any class and make a deck with 2 crabs  2 crawlers  2 ooze  eater of secrets  some taunt  transform or silence  heal  removal  and some sort of late win condition  Will lose to slowvalue decks like priest  curator Paladin  quest warrior  probably crystal rogue    but should be strong against murlocadin  pirate warrior decks  hunter and aggro Druid  Play 20 games  bet you suddenly see a slow control meta with little Aggro to farm\",
