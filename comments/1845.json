"[{\"comment\": \"I needed 2 fucking wins last night  I started playing at around 7 and by 10 I had my 2nd win  This game is such bullshit  Started at rank 13 and ended up at 15 with no stars  Every matchup was my worst matchup and they always had perfect answers and perfect curve  I decided to play freeze mage and faced FIVE secret mages in a row  I decided enough was enough so I switched to an agro paladin deck and the secret mages stopped and I got quest rogues and pirate warriors  I decided to try pirate warrior and started facing quest warriors  Why cant they just make matching making

horrible  Glyph is broken in burn Mage too  providing too much value  These things are completely obvious and I dont know whats sadderBlizzards cash grab as people play the new expansion cards to get
