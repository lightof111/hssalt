warrior who brawled when he had sylvanas and i had only a 11 and a 21  He also executed my 21 dark pedler  6 cards left in deck  No renounce  02 ThirdFifth game Pretty much same as the second game  I drew my whole deck but just could not find renounce  After game four  I actually had to go and check it was still in my deck  as i had drawn 72 cards from games 14 and picked up renounce 1 time  Fifth game  drew 20 cards  no renounce  05 92 cards drawn for one renounce  75 in a row  And that is excluding mulliganing  where i mulliganed my entire hand every match searching for renounce  5 losses  I finally pick up renounce in the mulligan against a priest  and get 2 cursed blades from my first four cards  I end up winning as he thoughtsteals my cursed blades and plays it for some reason  and i kill him with a lucky charge topdeck to put on my azure drake for 12 damage  But 75 damn draws  more including mulliganing  without drawing the one card i wanted\", \"commentId\": \"21244\",

what deck he was playing  but it was only a matter of time before he revealed the Molten Giant and other highmana cost cards and started to spam emotes  I dodged a potential 25 damage Holy Wrath  beat him but heres the issue  Why do people play ridiculous decks and get away with it They just go full on YOLO E G  Alarmobot on turn 1 or turn 1 Astral into YSharrj or something and you dont have the stuff to punish them with it  Additionally there are tons of streamers who play these kinds of decks and get away with it  yet when you yourself try it out it never seems to work  Granted  it is entertaining to watch  but the principle is stupid  I feel sorry for those players at the mercy of noskillallluck decks  To make things worse are the emote spams as if they are actually good players
