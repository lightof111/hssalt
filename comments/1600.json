fucking done  The reason I started to play this game was because the games had been really fast  like 5 minutes per game  How the fuck am I now supposed to play those fucking 35 minutes long games against Reno Nage who has somehow 3 Renos in his deck  A Fuckin LeagueOfLegends game is faster than a Reno mirror  fuck that  Tell me where is my motherfucking tier cancer deck as a Paladin player  Where is my strong reno deck  where is my strong pirate deck  where are my fucking jades   And foremost this netdecking is cancerous  get your useless brains out of your pants and at least change a few cards or normal people like me are only going to get a mental disease when playing in 8 out of 10 games against the exactly same deck  Are your brains less productive that you can t build a deck on your own I haven t played much last seasons and not planning to do so further till Reno is not out\", \"commentId\": \"33603\", \"commentDate\": \"1489394797\"}, {\"comment\": \"I just lost to a Tempo Mage cause my exact lethal that Ive been planning for 4 turns  was fucked up by an Antique Healbot    Why on earth would you run such card in Tempo Mage How am I supposed to play around that Now what I have to account for 8 extra damage against any Deck cause they might be running healing that they usually wouldnt just cause of Pirate Warrior  Well at least I completed the one quest I needed to finish so I guess Ill just go back to playing Shadowverse\", \"commentId\": \"33604\", \"commentDate\": \"1489395657\"}, {\"comment\": \"If you hope to play 5 minutes game with Reno Mage youre

seconds the game gives you  is messaging a pro to ask for advice  Maybe they just want to whey all options or are trying to set up card plays for a later turn to make the most of their mana   Yeah I get annoyed when people rope too  Either rope them back and if they are just trolling to force the game to take longer then theyll probably stop  If not and theyre not constantly roping until the last second and hitting the button then theyre likely a legitimate player who just takes a long time to make their decisions  Long turn time does not equal pro player aid\", \"commentId\": \"33606\",

hunter and tempo mage  Yes  there are other cancerous decks secret paladin and pirate warrior thats also been annoying  Luckily for me  I though that those 4 decks where out of the system by now  either nerfed or just bad  But no  Tempo mage is still a thing  On board he had a 13 mana wyrm and azure drake  I had a 55 jade chieftan with a 55 taunt and one heal totem  and one spell totem  He then plays flamewaker  flame waker  5 cheap spells  clearing the board and deals 17 damage to my face  Leaving my at 6 HP  I then manage to clear his board  and he has one card in hand  What does he top deck A freaking fireball  I hate tempo mage  Cant wait until drake and flame wanker gets the hell out of standard\", \"commentId\": \"33607\", \"commentDate\": \"1489403456\"}, {\"comment\":

new cards and we  even on this thread start to only speaking about this  This is right time to say goodbye  and this is salt  but i know i dont be missed to anyone and thats great  But  before that  in maybe 1 2 3 posts today I must say something  First of all  i must thank to this community  HS and this site hrtpwn  and thats main reason for this posts  Because via this things HSHPWN i learn sooo much from human psychology  And that is something i crucial   ultimate needed because i make books and want to resolve world problems want to be politician and knowing psychology is crucial to this two MAIN WORLD THINKS  And i will say goodbye and thanks today  and finally try finish my book without psychology thats be to me 10 years impossible  which i mean is masterpiece  and that will be my ticket tons of packs in HS to politic  I dont care about literature without politic its just talk talk talk     i dont care about HS thats just game  something what we do in free time  but in everything i doing i do my best  And what i learned from HSHPWN Salt think this is the time of onedimensional people  I know this before  i feel this 20 years ago  but here i have a confirmation of this  OneD people are thinking just about themselves  Pirate Warrior players  Reno  Freeze Mage players are symbols of that  They do no care about for example to play paladin hunter and all class in ranking  thats not HIS problem  Thats not problem for that people  And Ben HIS idol leader  politician Brode is give this to him  And thats a problem OneD people  Ben Brode  And what we have to resolve to problem Blizzard makes of Ben joke Brode video star  idol  celebrity To be honest he got legitimacy ticket because with his team he make HS  but he now got no lagality ticket because they make dr boom  patches  jade IDOL mechanic    what is criminal act  And nobody 29 000 000  exept 30 people on this thread   want even to see a problem Just see No And where is thing resolve a problem And thats great point of psychology  understanding world problem things  And thats why is worthwhile money for press the book i put in secondhand PC   and i thank my neighbour who give me internet  And a leave smoking  even worst OneD people friends  and i leave just like this HS  and go via book to real world  to politics  And i know i am poor and joke  but i must try this Because i HATE PROBLEMS  and i must try to RUIN paraphrase of George Bush Jr  the problem  Thats what i debt to myself  But i just be here until April  for curiosity  and to see begining my feeling and prediction of the end of HS today HS is in zenith  I dont count FUNs because they are joke  OneD people  Another  thanks for everything  and i be thankfull if someone  or administrator show me how to not make posts on HRTPWN after this  Goodbye forever  and good luck with RNG  Las Vegas slotmachine mechanic you more then life need this\", \"commentId\": \"33611\", \"commentDate\": \"1489404727\"}, {\"comment\":

world problem things Uhmmmm  no  Thats more like sociology  for starters  If we really want to put those things in a branch of study  In a loose way  Psychology is more about the individual and how it reacts to the world around him and inside him  It has nothing to do with world problems Also  to write a book if you intend to use Hearthstone as the frame to portray those psychological profiles  you need to write in english language at the very least to have whatever poolsize of readers to achieve the goals you are pursuing  And your english is    subpar Then you would have to invest on publishing the book  finding someone willing to invest money on its publication  and so on Then you have to take into account that reading books is becoming a niche hobby as time goes by and people who reads mainly reads book about stories  not studies All in all I think your whole idea is not going to jumpstart your career in politics  if not even kill it before its born  But hey  it really is
