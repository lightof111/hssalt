wait till Shaman has its cards rotated out  even if I dont agree with rotation in general  Goodbye Tunnel Trogg  Totem Golem  Flamewreathed Faceless  Thing from Below  it will be such a joyous day  The sad thing is Thrall is one my favorite characters in the whole Warcraft universe  but I despise the class current playstyle  Id like to see it return to a class that takes some actual thought when the next expansion hits  not this current mindless tier 0 bullshit that just destroys every deck and archetype  Its far and away the strongest deck in the whole game  but really thats not the part that bothers me  its that it takes no skill to just destroy everything else in the game  Thats why I respected Patron Warrior when it was the best deck of the meta  it was a highly skillful deck that only worked if you knew the deck inside and out to have great success with  Fuck Aggro Shaman  fuck its horribly designed minions  and fuck Doomhammer\", \"commentId\": \"24910\", \"commentDate\":

priest plays terribly  and at one point uses Silence on my Scarlet Crusader So Im feeling pretty positive  Yeah  thats a win I say to myself  Turn 8 comes around  i have a full board  Rag comes down  snipes my scarlet crusader  my minion with the highest power  I have 8 power on board  Now  i could trade my entire board for the rag  but thatd be stupid  right So i go face  Turn 9  Priest plays Confessor Paletress  uses his Hero Power  and gets Soggoth the Slitherer Now Im pissed  I have enough damage to kill the confessor and sogoth  but then what Ill loose to the rag  So i do that  dont have much of a choice  he plays Eldritch Horror and I loose  Now  without the perfect curve op legendaries with perfect rng on curve that noob would have lost   But no  He won  Good reminder for why i barely ever play this piece of shit rng game\", \"commentId\": \"24912\", \"commentDate\": \"1472344942\"}, {\"comment\": \"Fricking spent the past 1520 minutes sitting around with a Reno mage   I was

fatiguing  too  and it didnt draw a single card   I could have used those 20 minutes walking my dog or playing something worthwhile  but I wasted it  playing my heart out  just for a single win  and I
