arena  Im playing priest  He had 11 HP left  I had 25 and I had a cairne on board  His hand was decently full and he had a couple minions on board  while my hand was empty  All I have is a cairne on board because his madder bomber got lucky and pinged my other 1 hp minion  I topdeck a death and destroy his bomber  saving my cairne  Nothing on his side of the board can trade favorably into cairne  I hit his face thinking that this is going to be a race to the death  Now hes at 7 hp   Next turn starts and I topdeck a thoughtsteal   It gives me a windfury\", \"commentId\": \"27011\",

opponent has the same quality or INSANE quality  First arena run Priest 13 cynical arena run  the one win felt like three Second arena run Mage 13 no flamestrikes  only babbling book and flamewaker were cards if you can call that a fkin deck Third arena run Druid 43 with 2 swipes  2 azure drakes  Ancient of War  stranglethorn tiger  a bunch of 2 drops  and Menagerie Magician as my most prominent cards  Fourth Arena run Warrior 13 the only arena run that the 3 decks that beat me I considered legit  though the first three games I WENT FKING SECOND  the one win at 02 was literally curving my a
