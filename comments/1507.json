"[{\"comment\": \"Why shaman is better than warrior and frustrating to play against Shaman is based around winning more Thats why it sucked for a long time  It has no way to start winning  so the hero power became blank and cards like Mana Tide totem and Flametongue didnt do anything But suddenly  with good early game  all those cards become a massive problem and make the one really terrible thing about Hearthstone even worse the coin flip of the early game Thats how shaman can snowball an early lead into a crushing victory Shitty design brings you shitty results guys  Congrats\",

a spell  and another 0 mana spell Shadowstep so you cant recast this little motherfuker for 0 mana and get another spell  While you just sit there for 90 seconds and watch the other player play

Reno was a prolific deck before Standard hit   The only Reno deck that was remotely being played by a minority before standard was Renolock   In fact  Reno decks didnt even really proliferate until
