{\"comment\": \"This is actually the first season I actually tried to make it to legend  Although I might give it another go  my work schedule is picking up and I probably wont have nearly as much time as I did in the first few weeks  I was playing primarily wild reno mage  The frustration as I neared legend in Wild was that I could not find a solution that dealt with the four main threats simultaneously  I would tech certain cards that were very important in dealing with pirate warrior consistently  but these made my deck less viable vs  mirror matchups vs other reno mages  had minimal impact on egg druid  and had minimal impact on ancestral shamans  I was two stars from legend when I got five consecutive matchups against a mirror reno deck  that was just one or two cards more teched against control i e  me and slightly less vs  aggro  and so I then got bumped down to 2  Bear in mind that reno mage vs reno mage can be agonizingly slow and technical  like half an hour a match  Then  if I switched the few cards necessary to be competitive vs  reno  I then went back to facing pirate warriors over and over  While I previously had been favored against warrior  the few replacements put me back to unfavored  By the time I went to back to rank 3  I felt very frustrated considering it had taken me almost the whole weekend to work up to rank 1\", \"commentId\":
