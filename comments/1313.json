"[{\"comment\": \"The existence of some cards is a repeated kick in the teeth to players who want a fan and balanced game  WHO THE FUCK DECIDED TO A CREATE FLAMEWAKER AND B NOT NERF IT IN THE 18 MONTHS SINCE RELEASE Basically theres a fairly simple diagnostic test for working out if something is overpowered if it can bring out retartedly huge swing turns from absolute nowhere uusing very little mana then its just POSSIBLE that your card is overpowered  Im looking at you Thing from Below and Flamewaker\", \"commentId\": \"27534\", \"commentDate\": \"1478041937\"}, {\"comment\": \"i

sometime  I face a ton of priests so I make a hunter deck to counter them with burst finishers and a strong midgame  The moment I switch the deck to Hunter i will play 68 hunters in a row  The minute I switch Ill be playing 6 priests in a row  The matchmaking has been fucked for a long time  Im sick of boring mirror matches  They need to eliminate mirror matches altogether on the ladder  Like any card game I dont give a fuck how good you are if you dont draw the cards or have a shit opening hand your chances of winning are so far below 50 its not even worth playing the game  Try and tech against shaman and see how many shamans you play against Take those tech cards and deck choices out and see the 9 shamans in a row\", \"commentId\": \"27541\", \"commentDate\": \"1478089944\"},
