make a comeback  they just concede and the game ends wo any true satisfaction tbh i hate the rogue quest too  sign i know its counterable  but i dont like the idea how it encourages players to play extreme aggro decksPW wanted to kill the players before t6  so they wont play their reno  now the same thing before t5 i mean we just got pretty sweet defensive tools  that slow down aggro decks in our favour  but against a really fast combo deck they dont do much  inb4 i also stopped caring whether or not i will win the game  but i get annoyed that i encounter these decks almost everytime i just want to see something new\", \"commentId\": \"35105\", \"commentDate\": \"1491907354\"}, {\"comment\": \"I just wanna play my Taunt Warrior am i asking too muchIm only against Pirate Warrior
