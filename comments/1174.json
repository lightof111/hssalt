see so many lame warriors and hunters  In ladder I hardly fcking care  its no fun but I can understand that people want to climb up and have powerful decks    but it just kind of ruins the fun  Personally it does not get me that motivated to grind  it seems so pointless because its not interesting enough    especially since it takes so long before your Shieldbearers chest gives you something decent Despite ladder being free  it seems absolutely ridiculous that it pays off so little compared to even a single arena run  So tell me  what reason is left for me to go hard on ladder Yes hearthstone is meant to be open to new players but this way its not even fun anymore trying crazy not necessarily bad  jus not aggrod to the max decks  I think Im generally a hardtoruin fan of HS but I truly hope for some reason the devs are morons rather than fullknowingly selling out to dimwits playing ultra straightforward decks efficiently  They pride themselves on including cards for the fun element  but guess what You need to give them more edge for it to be interesting if aggro is so buff  to compensate for having to rely on RNG etc  Well ok I admit some people have success with total RNG insanity on ladder  so that is not my point but the aggro oncurve playing like a retard is too heavily rewarded  Balance is key so why dont you seriously reward late game by giving weak classes an ability to first survive  I can believe there are already ways to turn the tables so that should be enough for the next expansion  Sure for this Karazhan adventure I see cards fit the theme more than that they fit the actual game they will be used in but I can understand the excuse when developing an adventure  Much needed cards will have to patiently be awaited in the next expansion  But seriously  restore the balance in the next expansion and with all the fucking money you make dont be afraid to get some expert advice from the pros rather than waiting on their judgment    cause HS started as a major success and you have a duty to not ruin everything people invested  I appreciate that over time it does get more complicated although with the cycling this is minimized  good job I guess  For next expansion make absolutely sure that you have a feel for onesidednesses in the current meta and arena  I trust you are smart enough to counter that by analyzing where it lacks the most  Yeah an adventure can be a lot of fun and it shows youve been inventive but be careful it is not worth that much if the overall game is neglected meanwhile   If you try to make specific counters to e g  zooey decks  make sure that the card is not too worthless or overly expensive in other situations  otherwise it doesnt add advantage to a disadvantaged class It is clear you have logical ideas for compensation and try this under specific conditions but this gives you a skewed image  because you are not accounting for general purpose enough  a repeting theme imo So invest in proper consultancy  then develop a card and train it against a wide enough range of parameters that accounts for meta imbalance and allround value\", \"commentId\": \"24549\", \"commentDate\": \"1471869180\"},
