"[{\"comment\": \"All decks completely depend on legendarys with old gods    I mean  at least they throw you Cthun for free  But shit  theres no trading feature  Which Im not COMPLETELY pissed about  feel like it would be an issue with hackers  but my luck is god awful in opening these packs  I think Ive gotten about one or two legendarys in my entire hearthstone career  one being a damn hunter legendary  I HATE hunter  the other being that shitty 4 cost 43 or 34 divine shield when you cast on it card  So I threw away all of my wild cards to get a better standard setup  What do you want to bet half of those cards are going to be added to be standard again at some point or another Instant regret  But hell  Im not about to drop shitloads of money to get tons of duplicate cards because I have about every damn common and rare that are standard for mage and rouge the classes i care about  Then theres rouge  Holy crap what did they do to rouge Not even sure I need to explain the rouge issue I have  except I DONT HAVE THAT STUPID DEATHRATTLE LEGENDARY What the hell is the point in building it with dust anyways Rouge is still shit  Everything good about it has been taken away and replaced with deathrattle bullshit  I barely used deathrattle cards in my old rouges  the 1 spell dmg legendary being the key one i can recall  now its the only way to play the class and its not even any good especially without that damn legendary  the recent tavern brawl just solidifyed my decision to not even bother with rouge as its just a stupid setup  A 10 cost card to rez a ton of 24 cost deathrattle cards that mostly just summon minions on death that do shit for damage  good luck not dying anyways that late in the game wasting an entire turn on filling your board with random low damage cards  Though I must admit  It is hillarious watching people kill themselves with Yoggsaron and in all seriousness blizzard   H P  Lovecraft is a GOD and the decision to use his work for the newest set was a solid one  phew\", \"commentId\": \"24219\", \"commentDate\": \"1471307581\"}, {\"comment\": \"Blizz    stop fucking my card draw\", \"commentId\": \"24220\", \"commentDate\":
