rank 5 last season  Im very frustrated to be stuck in scrub ranks right now  I got to 13 and then booted back down to 17  and I cant seem to get back above 15  Its now Mean Streets of Renozan  and if youre not playing an extreme aggro deck that can reliably lethal on turn 5 or am extreme control deck that can waste the opponents resources and prevent them from ever gaining board control  you have no chance  In most cases youll know who is going to win the match by turn 3   1  Hunter is now trash tier  I love Hunter and have been playing Hunter since blackrock  Its not fast enough to beat all these reno decks  and it doesnt have any healing or board clear so it cant beat these aggro decks   2  Control Warrior sucks now  This used to be one of my favorites  It doesnt benefit from the no duplicate cards warlock  mage and priest do so you cant make a decent reno deck  which means youre stuck trying to armor up or hide behind taunts  The aggro decks are too fast to let you build armor and the control warrior decks lack the offensive power necessary to beat reno decks   3  Tempo mage is still viable  but its not fun to play anymore  Going spells to face all day is super lame  I miss when tempo mage required some thought  when you had to consider trades  Anyway its still not fast enough   4  Druid has always been somewhat broken  but relies so much on draw that it never managed to be top tier  even with its inherent cheating mechanic of ramping up mana  Jade Druid is so broken that its ridiculous  If you are running a super fast aggro deck you might have a chance  but if you are playing any kind of a control deck you will run out of removal long before he runs out of golems   5  Shaman is still super OP  Its pretty ridiculous  its almost impossible to prevent a shaman from getting board control in the early game   6  Matchmaking hard counters me like 90 of the time  Losing to unfavorable matchups is the worst  especially when you get a shit mulligan on top of it  Yesterday playing Hunter I went against warlock  warlock  priest  reno mage  warlock  priest  Really Those are all hard counters  So I switched to a CW deck and got matched up against nothing but jade druids and reno locks   It seems now that Reno rules the meta  which sucks because I am terrible at playing Reno decks  If Reno cw worked I would play that  but it doesnt  So I can either go Reno mage or handlock  I suck at hand lock so I guess Im stuck with Reno mage  Which  with this matchmaking system being the mess that it is  means I will probably exclusively face decks that hard counter me  because that has been the trend recently  Its like aggro was so op in the early release of the xpac that everyone went extreme controlreno to counter it  and now most of the decks in play are reno decks\", \"commentId\": \"29680\", \"commentDate\": \"1481989265\"}, {\"comment\": \"happened to me also    Ive found my peace with MiracleRogue    Its strong  thanks to earlygame pirates     sure
