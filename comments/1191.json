nessecary damage in a single turn Sure someones gonna bring up freeze mage but at least freeze mage requires some setup since it cant just burst you down from full even with armour  I honestly think warrior is the problem  since warrior is the class that enables such fun and interactive combos  and the biggest reason otk warrior is played is because other warriors have such health gain  Im not saying its an easy deck or anything  but its kind of telling that ever since the start of hearthstone warriors been the class that consitently can play dominant uninteractive decks molten otk  patron  worgen otk  dragon warrior and a lot of it i feel has to do with the design of warrior removal spells  But you know  aggro bad control good playing for board is uninteractive\", \"commentId\":
