"[{\"comment\": \"the burning was RNG  and it was due to a very simple play  Slam  Ravaging Ghoul on an Acolyte of Pain I played 4 turns ago  when my hand size was just average  It was a problem later because I was holding cards to keep playin after Brawl  but he inisted on not playing anything at all until that play  Only other targets were not killable by Slamghoul  so it was all pretty

is wich is do something that turns the board in your favor  lethals and requires good setting up  Dont act like a smartass now  That outplay is exactly the same kind as oh  look  low attack minion  eat this kodocabal Only difference is that it had to cost one of the two pieces of the win condition against fatigue nonpriest    because it was the only card between 18 that it could really hurt me to discard I drew CThun before  And well  Ill better stop  because now Im starting to feel annoyed\", \"commentId\": \"21607\", \"commentDate\": \"1465996686\"}, {\"comment\": \"DEAR BLIZZARD I WANT

brainless Aggro and Tempo decks  Tempo Mage  Tempo Warrior  CThun Druid  Midrange Hunter  Theyre all just face decks in disguise  It shouldnt be viable to play decks simply on the basis that they

so outplaying means only when you do something cool  Not when your opponent catches you with your pants down and gets you for being greedy  What a loser  You got outplayed  Getting your opponent to

suboptimally  Whenever someone tells me they outplayed their opponent  my first thought is oh  what did he do wrong  rather than wow good job  you played well  Funny how most people think that outplaying their stupid opponent and winning is actually better than playing perfectly but losing because their opponent played equally well\", \"commentId\": \"21612\", \"commentDate\":

only depends on the curve and only playing stuff to fill the board until either you can deal all of it and win or chipped to death  usually this happens is I patiently wait to not run out of damage  but when there is a perfect curve like shamans trogg  totem golem wolfs 77stupid card  etc  I lose my something  Sometimes my anger is not the players fault its a random game after all  Not zoo decks they can go  themselves but still I rage quit while swearing and wishing their death slowly and painfully while remembering how stupid they are to play zoo in a game which made for having some fun  I tried so hard to keep it civilized  It seems like I didnt showed my anger enough which I didnt express too extremely but still this somewhat calms me\", \"commentId\": \"21613\", \"commentDate\":

and he draws like 9 from a 3 mana card   I mean like wtf was blizzard thinking    Punishing for not playing your whole hand  for playing intelligently  So theres the option to just play retarded aggro decks like anyone else  at least you dont get fucked so hard by divine favor    But is this really fun Just SMOrc all the time I guess not  \", \"commentId\": \"21614\", \"commentDate\":
