is dust  Like you have 15000 dust on you Great  look for some netdeck  craft it  include your already owned another 138 legendaries and boom there you are  And what do you do with it Just puke out your removals every turn and hope with crossed fingers to live until turn 10  when you can start dropping your reamaining 135 legendaries still in a fear that you can get rekt before you can vomit enough legendaries to defeat your opponents 3000 dust worthy deck  Yeah  requires so much more skill and brain  than decideing every turn to go face or board  and hoping for at least an OK draw\",

vomit their minions without any idea they are pretty much a free win for any control  I dont hate control  and understand that everybody has their own preferences  I just dont think that in a game

in a control deck being much higher than that of a retard deck  the singular mistakes on high cost turns affect the outcome a lot more than that of an aggro deck  where the value is diluted for the
