confirmation bias conspiracy theory  How about you go track your games and see that your 5 games of no shaman are absolutely meaningless 2030 of the ladder is shaman  How many times in a row you do or dont meet a shaman is absolutely meaningless on the complete average  A bad matchup for you is a good matchup for your opponent  why isnt Blizz fucking their asses Why dont shamans get anything but freeze mages if the system is rigged FOH\", \"commentId\": \"28496\", \"commentDate\": \"1480344949\"}, {\"comment\": \"Because your MMR is also taken into consideration while matchmaking  There is also very easy explaination why wont shamans queue into freeze mage so easily  Because there is probably like 1 of freeze amges on ladder when 30 of players play midrange shaman  Did you think about that Secondly queing into midrange decks  zoo and so on as a freeze mage too often would give you sth like 70 winrate which blizzard dont want to allow in any of their games  The fact that you didnt think of such explainations makes you totally worthless to speak about such matters as most people seeing that there is sth not right about matchmaking try to find reasons for both why it might be rigged and why it actually isnt  httpus battle netforumsenoverwatchtopic20745504371 Here you can check how it works for Overwatch  Its not most persuading assumption that if in a SOME1 DID STH on one occasion he will do it every time but it means you can actually  expect of him that he will repeat his action somewhere else  Like in a case of matchmaking system in blizzards games\", \"commentId\":

your own bias  and when its asserted e g  you dont meet shamans  preexisting conclusion affirmed and when you do meet the shaman you assume it as the norm  I didnt think of such explanations Because

30   shamans  How can you match bigger amount of players to smaller  100 shamans and 100 freeze mages  its possible  100000 shamans 100 freeze mages  its not possible  What else hard counters shamans
