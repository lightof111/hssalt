impossible  I have to win the games alone  because my teammates do everything in their power to get the entire board destroyed  half my deck milled  and using every single buff cards on the wrong minions literally before nefarian explodes for 30 damage  This is what truly proves that most of the players are dumb  have zero logic  and the only reason they are successful on ladder because their decks are autopiloted towards the face  Seriously  this brawl is so easy to win  You get to the second phase  the shaman plays the minion which gains 11 after any card played Intrepid Dragonstalker  the priest buffs it to oblivion  windfury  stall until HP is over 30 preferably 60  and OTK in the last stage  Having double upgraded priest hero power is also decent  But no  my partner decides that tentacleing  inner fire on my validated doomsayer is a great play Just as rockbitering nefarian turn 1   Now I feel better  Even if I lose on ladder  I know that at least Im not a retard with zero logic  As Im writing this  another priest player managed to waste every single buff card to summon a 2228 mukla before stage 3 GG\", \"commentId\": \"24496\", \"commentDate\": \"1471771637\"},

ruining the game  Every other game on ladder is warrior and they have like 56 competitive decks  Dragon Warrior is still the best deck in the game  bar none  Then theres CThun and classic control warrior  Theres the complete bullshit OTK deck and whatever new cancer giant deck that Reynad built and then theres always Patron  No other class comes even close to having so many viable competitive

in fact buff to oblivion whatever you have  I used to beat it with massive Fjolas great card if used wisely in that brawl  Corrupted Healbots    and even Zombie Chows  Also a very big Bloodlust can

you dont concede you have to deal with that bullshit  the only time youre allowed to rope is if the other person is roping too  as for the armor  wow  bran and shieldbearer twice that hurts  man \",

down between rank 11 and 13  grinding all day with FeastResurrect Priest   Yes I know there were misplays here and there  but Priest is the class I have the most experience with  I can tell you for certain that in many of my losses  I straight up outplayed my opponents on every turn  but because their deck had more room to make mistakes  they could still win   Finally I said fuck it  and played aggro shaman   Went 50 to Rank 11   I have next to no experience with Aggro Shaman  and Im positive Im fucking up a lot of turns    Hearthstoneladder is not a measure of skill its a measure of deck

 I had the same experience earlier this week  I didnt reroll the quest though since I want as much gold as possible for adventure wings  People were just bad at the brawl in the worst way  Just the dumbest decisions I have ever seen  It was on the dumbness level of any of WiseAsPlatos posts here  The only good teammate I had was the first one on the first day the brawl was out  I guess only the idiots stick around and play tavern brawl for more than just getting the free pack\", \"commentId\": \"24507\", \"commentDate\": \"1471797175\"}, {\"comment\": \"You mean of every rank in ladder  and
