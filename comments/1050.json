and was up against only 2 rogues this season and both of them had 1010 Edwin van Cuntface on turn 2  Probably the same dicks who swear by that rogue is the hardest class to play  I swear to god my last game the shaman probably blocked and healed a total of 60 damage with his perfectly rouletted totems  I had lethal the next turn but of course another one of his 4000 taunt totems stopped me to give him lethal instead with the cliche lame ass rockbiter lavaburst Cunthammer combo because of course he has all the lavabursts he needs even though he lavabursted my 23 a turn earlier and fucking lightning bolted a 11  instead of trading with wolves only to buff his Trogg and get overloaded  Its all a fucking joke and any fucking retard with fingers and enough luck can win  Its always the same when I go up against these hand spewing  totemvomiting retards but whenever I play shaman I always get the worst  totems in any given situation situation  Opponent has a frothing or an imp gangretard Give 11 totem  Need healing totem  get spell damage  Oh opponent has 1 health minions Fuck you  heres another healing totem on your board that was just wiped out  Yeah I give up on trying for legend in this stupid luckbased bullshit  I feel ashamed I even sunk so low as to be a tryhard and put my heart in it and even let myself get stressed out about it  Fuck getting prematurely grey haired over a stupid game  Its not an accomplishment to achieve anything in this game anyway  all thats needed is the flavor of the monthexpansion cards  godly amounts of luck and time and any fucking retard with fingers and out of a job can be the creme de la creme of this lame ass casino  Fuck all of you lucky pimpleclad dweebs and my sincerest feels to those who are unlucky like me\", \"commentId\":

decided it is better to hit my face with a FIREBALL instead of killing my Baron Geddon while I was on 27 HP  In the end he topdecks Yogg who kills all my minions  draws him Cards and shadowsteps
