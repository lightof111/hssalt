"[{\"comment\": \"Until you can prove without any doubt that the game isnt luck  my statement stands correct   I know the dateless teenagers want it to be skill because it makes them feel better but a game with such a huge amount of rng and draw luck cannot be skill based    Only an idiot would believe that   Cmon  you either draw what you need or you dont   If you do you win  if you dont you lose   Its fine   its just fucking lame that they wont take more luck out and let us have access to re of our deck or at least sideboards so we can adjust in game  But  they have to make it a casino  Sorry

any more money for this game ever again  theyve created the most toxic playing environment imaginable with this piece of shit broken meta decks that force you to play them or their equally broken meta

them for letting Aggro Shaman ruin the ladder  and now fuck them for letting pirates ruin the fucking ladder  Never give them money  you are being fucking conned and your rank means nothing because if you climb high on the ladder you MUST ride one of the broken netdecks and whats the fucking point if a bot can do it because the decks are so OP they pretty much play themselves  In before fucking
