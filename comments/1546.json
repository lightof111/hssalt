was Shaman 110 was Jade Druid with a whole bunch of other stuff mixed in   But no  Everywhere you go    Renoloc  Reno priest  Reno Mage  pirate warrior  Jade Druid  Shaman    people playing those decks should feel deep shame for their lack of creativity  This season Ive experimented on standard ladder with nondragon priest  two  completely different zoolocs   a slow warloc  and currently nonanyfin  nzoth style paladin  Its possible to make some upward progress but the vomitous wave of the meta decks is depressing  especially the pirateRenoJade flood  It used to look like each season you could have fun trying to build off meta decks and ladder up to rank 10 or so    but its just morphed into a play these expansion deck or get punished kind of game  which is deeply  deeply unsatisfying and very frustrating and very boring  Hearthstone is sitting at 310 for entertainment value for me right now  it used to be 68 10  Brode should quit  his ideas about balance and

pirate rogue who leveraged STB and cold bloods to smorc me by turn 6  The game is no fun at all unless you play the broken cards waiting for nerfs  The devs really proved their incompetence in a very
