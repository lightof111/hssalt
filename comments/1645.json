it fun when all you do is vomit your hand onto the board  and hit face  There is absolutely zero thought in any pirate warrior play that ive seen   I played against 4 in a row earlier  and not once did they do anything other than go to face   I dont know   I prefer something that actually stimulates my brain  and makes me think about what is going on  but thats just me   Either way  I wish blizz would do something to remove this cancerous aggro deck  because it makes having a decent time playing this game almost impossible   I wish I could say that Ill wait for the new expansion to launch so I could go back to enjoying it  but I dont see Pirate Warrior going anywhere anytime soon\", \"commentId\": \"34554\", \"commentDate\": \"1491193328\"}, {\"comment\": \"I just cant fathom how Im lucky
