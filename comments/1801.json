think its time to just post it  get it out  Fuck quest rogue  seriously  fuck that deck   Its not because its unbeatable I play many decks that beat it   Im just sick of Blizzards half assed attempts at nerfs   Do you know what cards got nerfed for less bullshit than quest rogue  I can name 2 off the top of my head that are relevant   Both warrior cards   Warsong Commander  and Charge  Blizzard  why were these cards nerfed  Oh  because you didnt like people being able to do 2030 damage in one turn  Even though in both decks they were used you had to assemble all the right pieces and opponent had a lot of time to kill you unless you had the absolute nuts  So  heres Blizzard Hurr durr  2 combo decks warriors play Patron Warrior and Worgen Warrior  oh noez they have to draw a ton of cards and not die in the mean time in order to pull off an OTK  we gots to nerf dem decks even though they do take some skill and thought to play   A few years later  Hurr durr  new expansion coming up  we have to make quests  lets give rogues a quest that takes very little skill to play and can easily output 20 damage in one turn  which doesnt require nearly the amount of combo pieces and card draw Patron and Worgen Warrior needed Fuck these assholes  Brode and all of Team 5 should be fired   Either give every class an OTK deck possibility or no one   Fuck your bullshit half measures  While were at it  fuck silence priest for the same exact reasons\", \"commentId\": \"37759\", \"commentDate\": \"1495364408\"}, {\"comment\": \"At least being rank 15 means I can concede to quest warrior  pirate
