and lose 2 Ellek jousts where opponent draws 2 Savannah Highmanes vs my 1drop as a big FU to me  Im still pretty calm at this stage  Opponent leaves me a beast on board and goes face with his weapon and rollhuffer allowing me to get back into the game with Houndmaster  Im able to play 2 Call of the wild in a row  can clear his board except from Highmane and setting up for a kill next turn with 32 dmg on my board  He already played his hunters mark and removal except deadly shot and animal bite I think  Some turn before he had wasted his weapon on my face and rolled huffer and  at this point Im 10 hp  My board is 2xLeokk  1x Misha  1x Huffer  2x Hyena  1x fiery bat  His board is 1   Savannah  He plays deadly shot  hits the one taunt out of fucking 7 fucking animals and is able to go face
