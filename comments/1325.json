is  they are likely playing it for murloc quest  i had it a few times and went into casual and crushed some control warriors and such around t4  murloc rogue isnt bad either with conceal and cold blood  just runs out of steam faster    Ive actually been playing a lot of rogue the last 2 weeks getting about 150 ranked win with reno and miracle nzoth lists  the burgle version was too slow but insanely fun  maybe not the best winrate  but i climbed to about rank 14 with it before it turned into shaman city and the deck dropped to 0 winrate\", \"commentId\": \"27787\", \"commentDate\":

in a row  all with perfect hands  All right  just as expected  so I go to casual to complete my priest quest  Guess what  another 3 shamans in a row  The retarded fact is that I would have won every single match with just half the curve or luck they had  but no  I just have to be unlucky straight for months  I guess its natural that I dont get a 123 drop except kill command with hunter for several games  while every shaman has trogg and golem  weapon  or out of 4 minions  I resurrect a hexed frog two times  Im happy I can roll the unluck in one week that compensates for other 10 players
