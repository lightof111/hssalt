"[{\"comment\": \"Vicious Fledgling can we please all ACCEPT that blizzard is fucking damn SLOW in adjusting cards is fucks me off that its obvious that some cards arewere just bad for the game and they take months to do something about it  regarding the fledgling nobody could say its a fun card to play  everybody i speak to  who won because of it  says its stupid  Primordial Glyph is not a cool card too  but sometimes you really have fun playing it  you get a cool card and you can adjust your gameplan to it  hope someones sees my point here and could agree\", \"commentId\": \"38452\",

they roll the divine shield  3HP  stealth  or notarget  it can be impossible to remove because next turn it likely gets another adapt   The card can win a game by itself and I run at lest one in most
