Noble Sacrifice  Avenge buffing it to a 66 T3 He plays another secret which turned out to be a Competitive Spirit  Overall  he had a 1 mana 88 minion with less health due to pings and freezes which hit me 23 times during the game   By turns 67 I started stabilizing being at 1 hp  And he topdecks Divine Favor drawing him 5 cards for 3 mana  Ah  I love this game\", \"commentId\": \"27135\",

has there ever been such an incentive to play cheap  basically aggro cards and rarely are control decks punished so hard for not doing so   I play Nzoth Priest in wild so have a good win rate against

careful to spam emotes at secretadins when I have lethal\", \"commentId\": \"27137\", \"commentDate\": \"1476882818\"}, {\"comment\": \"Played some more control warrior  and once again got heavily

{\"comment\": \"You  friend  are not alone  Ive had 8 or 9 games in a row when the first winaxe only appeared after turn 7 or later  Im running a Yoggless CW and I struggle with Bloodlust coming back in midrange shaman  First Shaman I kinda overlooked the chance of Bloodlust so I didnt clear his totems  my bad  Second one actually outplayed me forced my brawls out early  props to that guy  he did play pretty good  Third one I beat because health dropped to 5 and I got Revenge on 3 damage  but he still managed to go toetotoe with me up until fatigue So yeah  I know its a broken record  but I  too  am both impressed by the strength of the midrange Shaman archetype and I dont hate the deck or the players  but I am sad that the meta is dominated by only ONE deck in tier 1 and that that deck is cheap and requires little skill except chucking out cards on curve and that that deck is STILL able to beat every other deck except very specific counters looking at you  freeze mage  Itd be nicer if there was something of a balance of decks  and that those deck archetypes scaled in performance as you become more skilled  Like Kripp said  if you play midrange shaman  you WILL become legend  The ladder does not encourage you to actually get better or creative  and Id just like it to do that\", \"commentId\": \"27140\", \"commentDate\": \"1476891319\"}, {\"comment\": \"Im so sorry  every
