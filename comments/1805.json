dead card when you are ahead  just wtf  it doesnt even clear the board to delay for pyro in the lategame vs midrange decks  its only ok vs aggro if you draw it and then you need a perfect setup or some other times you would be ahead if you played some tempo card like Kirin Tor and not have to clear anything  mentally handicapped right there  And shoutout to Paladin who draws 2x Consecration in first 10 cards  that was extremely skilled of him just like a few perfect openingperfect totem roll mouth breathers I played against today  NA really is a trash server like Asia but who cares if you misplay when you topdeck your second Golakka Crawler on turn 2  the fact that I still had a chance to win that game means there is seriously wrong with your gameplay  Anyway legend NA is taken  legend on 3 servers now  Id go for top 100 on all 3 but Im not sure whether electroshock therapy is a good idea with my last exam coming up on the 24th\", \"commentId\": \"37837\", \"commentDate\":

5 cancer decks is certainly no better than a meta with 2 cancer decks  Still have ZERO interest in giving Blizzard any more money to play this crappy game  Who gets happy to see hunter drop that alley cat We know EVERY card they run  So boring and if your deck doesnt have an answer  game over  Who likes to see Rogue play their quest Who goes cool a taunt warrior  removing all their taunts will be fun Who likes to see tidecaller into Rockpool hunter from pally Fly poly Fuck off you shrivelled little cock     so many boring OP decks  The sad thing is they dont show statistically as being OP
