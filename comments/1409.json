a double whammy   One  I have either the Paladin deck or Druid deck  both of which suck worse than the Priest deck does   Two  I have to watch the moron running the Priest make terrible plays and yet win effortlessly   Im sure when I finally get the Priest deck  I will draw into garbage and get killed by some noob\", \"commentId\": \"29538\", \"commentDate\": \"1481760789\"}, {\"comment\": \"Win

absolutely loathe Anybody who gives me rope on any turn ever I have no respect for you  None  Less than none  Contempt actually  There should be 1 point health penalty for every second of rope you burn   Anybody playing one of the current cancer netdecks   Secret Paladin  Face Shaman  Jade Druid  Pirate Warrior etc etc  I finish most seasons around rank 10 without netdecking  the rank you get with your mindless  boring  OP  broken shit  is meaningless to me because bots can get legend with those decks  in fact if you are not legend playing a welltuned net deck you are a dumber fuck then a bot  And bots are pretty dumb  Any emote beyond a turn 1 greeting  Especially well played to signal lethal  I dont care whether you genuinely mean it or not  you come off as as a pathetic social retard   Why cant we have auto squelch in the game settings End salt\", \"commentId\": \"29540\", \"commentDate\": \"1481768286\"}, {\"comment\": \"I was playing against dragon warrior  managed to win

Fair enough  I expect to lose to broken shit when Im playing a bunch of common cards which arent even very good  but this wanker I was playing thought so much of his comebacks that he was spamming
