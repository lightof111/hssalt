play YOGG SARON in JADE DRUID what the fuck  this card was nerfed to death but its fucking ridiculous in jade druid  once you can bring a jadedruid in a bad position  they just play yogg and pray to BBB  WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT yogg is fun  YES i like it to play him too  but the RNG of him is so stupid that he should be banned for at least standard you can turn a whole game from lose to win with him  especially with a jadedruid  your opponent build a board and even if you push out big jades he will win well just lets fuck up his entire board with RNG  three times now i was winning against a jadedruid with a controldeck and they just smashed yogg and won  the really bad thing here is YOU CANT PLAY AROUND YOGG  i can play around every card without rng and even around some cards that discover only one card  but yogg is incredible  it grants you a possibility of rng that shouldnt exist in ranked and competitive\", \"commentId\": \"33397\", \"commentDate\": \"1489104434\"},

the world ever   Its like you WIN the fucking game but oh wait     not   Who the fuck  Why the fuck  What the fuck  And there is ZERO penalty for making a deck using that fucking asstard card   You just play one of everything or not even really   ZERO fucking penalty  Reno should cost 8 mana   Then  there needs to be a battlecry block card or spell that we can use for that shit  Just awful\",

their ladder matchmaking system peaking at your card list and choosing opponents somehow based on it  At this stage I just firmly believe they are outright lying  I dont know whether it is to keep winrates of certain broken decks under control or to encourage purchasing of new expansion packs  I just made an inner fire priest deck total cheese balls I know but my 4 matchups have been 1 Reno Priest 2 Dragon Priest 3 Pirate Warrior and 4 another inner fire priest I literally have not seen an inner fire priest on the ladder in weeks of play easily playing 3 hours a day  The second I make one however    fucking manipulated matchmaking  somebody should investigate this and sue them for breach of contract  selling us one thing a collectible card game with random rank based matchmaking but giving us a collectible card game with mathmaking manipulated to keep deck winrates advantageous to our business Edit  I know this is not statistical proof  I know about confirmation bias  I know about sample sizes  This is just one more small dataset in a long history of suspicious bullshit observed over multiple seasons  I have a degree in pure mathematics and graduate qualifications in statistics  Please dont embarrass yourself trying to argue mathematically  statistically  or logically  Im probably better than you at those things  its how I make my living  Edit 2  followed by 5 consecutive pirate warriors  all of a sudden Shaman and  Jade Druid do not exist  9 consecutive games only Priest and warrior  Ill now change  decks  Edit 3  switched to a strange Pally deck  Hunter  Paladin  warrior  Mage  Jade Druid  warrior  Mage  hunter  priest  mage oh look the meta changed when I switched decks it was 33 priest 67 pirate warrior  now its only 10 priest and 20 warrior  just for a laugh Ill switch back to inner fire priest now\", \"commentId\": \"33407\", \"commentDate\": \"1489117680\"}, {\"comment\": \"apparently aggrowater rogue is really strong right now   i am
