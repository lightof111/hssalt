thought was Dragon Tempo Warrior  He goes first turn NZoth First Mate  face  then Alex Champion face  then genrally plays like a standard TempoAggro Dragon Warrior  Therefore I fight with tempo  build a board    Then he Brawls  Then he plays Ysera  Shield Slam and other control cards  What a fucking idiot mixes aggro with control Next was Priest  strange Priest  who played basically only board clears and removal  I mean sure  most Priests play just like this  but that least have win conditions  NZoth  CThun  Elise or whatever  He played nothing that would tell me what kind of Priest he was  I run Reno Paladin  I hold on to Tirion till he plays both Entombs  I baited both of them  one Death and I didnt care if he Deathed it  since I had Rag and NZoth follow up  so I assumed its finally time to safely drop Tirion  He topdecks  Mind Control   Why the fuck would you run Mind Control in a deck How do you plays vs aggro with so much late game removal I could probably still win the game  since I had silence  other late game threats he couldve hardly remove  but I was so pissed so I conceded  Seriously  how are those people going to ever win with such shitty counterproductive decks

thats it  Warrior isnt fyucking balanced or some godsent class anymore like you shitheads has made it look like  I didnt want to admit it but now I do  WARRIOR IS CANCER  23 of my ladder in EU Rank

\"No  I played gimmick  this is fun deck but with consistent plan  deck that works  just isnt meta  They played standard decks just with techs how can you even call something like this a tech that were counterproductive to their strategy  I dont know if they didnt have enough cards I dont have Deathwing Imm play Ysera  its the same No Blood to Ichor But I have Shield Slam I miss NZoth Well  Mind Control is a late game card  should work the same  shouldnt it  Gimmick vs standard deck just built by a retard  This is the difference  Also even if I indeed cursed on gimmicks here and acted like a hypocrite  Im allowed to do so  this is a thread to blow off steam  I can rage even at worlds pollution  Why do people like you keep responding to messages in this thread Its not the thread for

enough card to push lethal and ignore his deathwing since i was full HP   His next turn  he hero power something and hit me in the face with DW  im now at 18  I drop my whole hand  forcing him to trade since i have lethal on board   He then proceed to go face again dropping me to 6HP and drops ANOTHER FREAKING DEATHWING on me  No Esportal  no weird shenanigans   the guy drafted not only one  but TWO DEATHWING  Im not even mad  this is the most ridiculous thing ive seen in 2000 games of HS  Unbelievable Salty or not  this made my day  I was on phone at the job in break obv and didnt manage
