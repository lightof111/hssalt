"[{\"comment\": \"The game is a shitty  formulaic  boring mess  All the people playing Shaman  Jade Druid  Reno decks and Dragon Priest  70 of the player base  should hang their heads in abject shame  It is possible to roll your own deck you know  Rank in this meta is meaningless  People tell me they hit rank 5  I ask what deck  its usually Shaman  I just walk away laughing at them  What a waste of a great game this has become  Im so glad I havent spent real money on packs for the last 2 expansions  I hope the whole game implodes  How can any selfrespecting  intelligent person get any satisfaction at all out of grinding these meta decks I dont know the name of any game designer except one  Ben Brode  and I know hes incompetent and deserves firing\", \"commentId\": \"33353\",

semidecent Priest deck  got a Dragonfire Potion  some decent cards and dragon synergy should be good for around 7 wins from my experience  So lets just ignore the fact that I died to a perfect constructed Aggro Shaman on turn 6 in my first game  and skip to 11 the druid I beat after had Fandral  tier 1 Druid cards lined up too   My opponent  Warlock  pulls out a Brann Bronzebeard  Kazakus 444four combo on freaking turn 7   Like  I am not even salty for once  this is freaking awesome  My opponent not just found AT LEAST 2 legendaries  which just happened to be literally the best combo for value in the game currently  he had it ready on turn 7  and also didnt have any duplicates in his deck which is even harder now  considering that the pool we get to chose from is smaller Luckily  even such an insane deck cant carry if you dont play decent  so I managed to steal the win   but holy crap  is this what every arena opponent will look from now on These are actually constructed level decks  all 4 of my opponents so far had insane cards   and not at 100 or something  its the earlier stages    Update Shaman at 6 wins  goes first  plays Buccaneer turn 1 and he pulls out a Patches   again  in ARENA This is insane D Also  same guy pulls out Doppelgangster  Evolve at turn 6\", \"commentId\": \"33365\", \"commentDate\": \"1489072344\"}, {\"comment\": \"Make charge minions cost more
