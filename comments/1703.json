every other tech card in this game   Its utterly worthless like 95 of the time   Its a garbage body and has to be drawn at the perfect time   Even so  since Mage is broken due to being able to pull 3  4 or even 5 ice blocks you cant possibly deal with ALL of them   Then  your board gets frozen for like 8 straight turns too   So wonderful and interactive   Fucking stupid  Why do people insist on defending it  Its broken   It violates the games rules due to being able to have more than two copies of a card played  Its OK if you like playing solitaire   All good   But dont try to sell everyone else that knows better that somehow its legit   Its not   Sorry   And Eater of Shit doesnt help   Not even fucking close\", \"commentId\": \"35728\", \"commentDate\": \"1492728811\"}, {\"comment\":

perfect topdecks   Even with confirmation bias  the overwhelming majority of my games are just me getting wrecked in every single possible way  It has gotten to the point where I just enjoy running through my head all the craziest scenarios that my opponent might manage to pull rng plays  HailMary draw cards  Most of the time I can predict the exact playanswer that they will have  while I am staring at my hand with nothing I can possible use at that moment   I feel I might be stuck in some proverbial farming hell  where I constantly serve as the ladder fodder for most of my opponents  Or

swashburgler that day when i posted this i played a shaman and the rogue just summoned 4 55 murlocs for 4 mana  the swashburgler himself  how could i have done with itand its not the only case  in fact there are even worse ones  when the rogue gets spells from other classesi watched a trumps video where his opponent summoned 7 55 tentacles because RNGeesus said soi read a thread in this forum

decks run while they maximise new pack sales and only nerf when everyone who wants to pay to win playing the cancer has bought packs  Its NOT a collectible card battle game with fair games where useful cards and strategies can be built over multiple seasons  Its pay to play the cancer and have an unfair laddering advantage  Quest Rogue is just this expansions Pirate Warrior before STB nerf  or huntertaker before undertaker nerf  or Secret Paladin before rotation etc etc etc  NEVER GIVE BLIZZARD MONEY FOR THIS BROKEN  SHIT  CON OF A GAME  You will ultimately regret it if you do  and voting with your wallet is the only way they will take notice  if revenues collapse they might fire Brode and actually move toward a game that is fair  balanced and fun  At this point in time its not living up to its potential in those respects\", \"commentId\": \"35738\", \"commentDate\": \"1492738703\"}]"
