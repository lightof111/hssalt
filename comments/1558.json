with this game  So Im a f2p player except for the solo adventures since you basically need half those cards  to even have a chance  So I decided I would be pretty dedicated in Gad  by doing a bunch of quests and all that  basically trying to max gold ever day  I really wanted to play jade druid at start  so I crafted Aya and Fangdral  and it was fun  I opened packs expecting to only get legendaries every now and again  but I did not expect it to literally take me into pity packing to get them  So after over two months I have opened my second legendary  I was fine with the first one being Raza  since I wanted to try Reno and it was also fun  Now then back to the second legendary  it was fucking raza again  So I am pretty pissed obviously  since over a month of playing pretty much comes to almost no change at all  I used to open a lot of classic packs  and I recall opening three packs in a row where I got Rag   in a row  I like Rag  but three times in a row is such bullshit  Including in that  they are taking one of my favorite cards away from me  Literally shoot me in the head  Now I hear that the next expansion is not going to be a solo adventure where I only have to pay like 20 bucks or so to get guaranteed good cards  but instead is going to be another pay to win expansion  and so are the two after that  I was looking for a good reason to try Shadowverse since I heard its good  but I was not too enthralled by the anime tentacle porn of it  But I am officially done with Hearthstone  its just such a waste  I dont want to play months of games versus pirates and jade decks  to only be able to add a new card to one of my decks every 2 or 3 weeks  and then get totally fucked every two months  I would try arena  but in the past I was always bad at it  while Im usually like 75 or 80  in casual and ranked  Please give me a reason why I should still play this game  since I want to still like it  but it has let me down\", \"commentId\": \"32710\", \"commentDate\":

your way   This fucking Mage drafted a Karakus which went into one of the best potions possible  and before that played the 5mana Yogg into Lunar Visions  plus got Pyroblast from Conjurer just to name the stand outs    Its just sickening    All the while i roll back to back worst ImpPlosions and cant top deck anything to save my life  Then we can go into another loss against a Paladin that just happened to have 2 Outfitters in opening hand will holding 100 minions on both battlecrys then right after gets 2 Muster for Battles   Once again i cant top deck a answer to save my life  Fuck this
