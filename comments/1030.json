priests  Druids  and fatigue or control warrior  Not a single Shaman deck  I wish somebody with legal chops would take a class a action suit against Blizzard  their claim that matchmaking is random is clearly a lie  In the last few seasons it has become obvious that you must play the current cardsdecks from the expansion that is being sold or else the matchmaking system queues you in to hard counters for your off meta deck  I guess that makes sense  they cant allow competitive decks to exist that use old cards or else they wouldnt sell the new expansion decks  but they need to be honest about it  Lying asshats  update 2 more consecutive priest matches both dragon priest  there is an algorithm designed to encourage playing the cards blizzard are currently selling  I guarantee it  update  hunter  Mage  dragon priest Im glad there are no Shamans on the ladder   update  hunter  dragon priest  nzoth priest 18 consecutive games no Shamans  mainly mirror matches OK so now Ill switch to a Shaman deck and see what I get\", \"commentId\": \"21493\", \"commentDate\": \"1465695657\"}, {\"comment\": \"It certainly feels like that more often than I like  A couple days ago I was getting

delete you without being able to respond is beyond cowardice   Example being I was facing a hunter  with the same net deck as them all  go figure  and I was playing a Yogg Mage in standard of my own design  majority of the deck spells to clear the board until a 20 spell Yogg  Deck did well  about a 65 win rate only trouble with aggro shams mostly  But this guy adds me after the match as tells me Your deck sucks all you did is the clear the board repeatedly thinking to myself of course I was its one point of the deck to control  Then he followed it up with seconds after Or maybe you just suck at piloting it get good I simply try to respond its a Yogg Mage  but he had alrdy unfriended me  So I add him  and he responds dont blame me for you sucking and unfriended again  Before I could ever reply  and I was just going to be friendly  as Ive filled most of my friends list from people after matches of close games or crazy wins     Its just  ridiculous  what do u get out of doing something
