"[{\"comment\": \"Stalest meta weve ever had  and dispite saying a lot  the devs havent actually adressed and fixed any of the problems  aggro decks  shaman and warrior are still on top with their

{\"comment\": \"Yeah  Ive honestly stopped playing hearthstone competitively  I was never super competitive before  but I can remember not having a difficult time getting to rank 5 or so  and now its a slog to get up to rank 10  I dont know if the average person is just better or has a better collection  or if it is the game  or what  Im playing people with well tuned  high dust cost decks in the high teens  which is ridiculous compared to how it was back in the day  Arena is disheartening too  My winrate has just plummeted  Again  I dont know if it is the relative strength of the people I am facing or the direction that arena has headed  but getting to 7 wins for me is the new 12  I used to be able to get to 12 around 5 of the time  and 7 slightly less than 40 of the time  but now it seems like most arena runs end at 3  I just had a pretty solid paladin deck that went 13  The matches were close  but I felt like I lost the board on turn 34 because of ridiculous plays  such as smugglers cache  fire elemental kodo on turn 5  or having removal for every minion I played turns 38 against a shaman with tunnel trog on board and just could never recover which can be an issue with paladin due to lack of removal  but I digress  I mostly only play hearthstone to complete quests and play fun decks  I feel like the RNG or something is too much for competitive play without dedicating a lot more time to playing the game  I play hearthstone primarily during commutes and to kill time here and there  No way I would commit more time  Arena used to be easier for some reason  so now I play it much less frequently  and only really play ladder to complete quests  Thanks  qq helped\", \"commentId\": \"32256\", \"commentDate\": \"1487004643\"}, {\"comment\": \"5 arena runs  9 times anally ravaged by Kabal Chemist  This is such a fucking dumb card  You cant be unhappy with any result because its always the one you need  Looks like Im not outvaluing this guys deck but Ill do a final push because he didnt have a boarclear last turn  Whats that topdeck Chemist into Felfire Ah yes  Got a few burn spells left in the deck  fairly good chance at drawing them Ill just frostbolt

are just try to get an early push  Oh I fail  I lose  because Reno exists And thats about the game now  Can you win before Reno  or is there Reno Can you draw Reno Are you a skillstone Reno drawer Woo I cant even do daily quests anymore the game is so bad  Nothing about hearthstone is fun at this point Been watching Kripp struggle to enjoy the game for a week now as well  He hates at least 50 of

 but I just dont feel like playing anything for more than the daily quest reward  Im f2p  been here since around the end of Beta  and I have almost all the important cards for any deck archetype except Patches and 1x Smalltime Buccaneer lulz   its just boring to play  I cant bring myself to reach rank 10  while I was a regular rank 5 player before  Im not feeling salty  but I dont like the game much right now  And I cant see anyone new starting and sticking around really  unless they get really lucky with the first few packs and get most of the cards for one of the metadecks   even then

I did this one    Played perfectly without a single mistake whole match  outvalued him with choices guy just dropped Kazakus without Brann  drawing cards from his Cleric like there is no tomorrow  which is misplay in mirror matchups  you dont even play Cleric ever  etc  so he was 2 turn earlier into fatigue even with topdecked Entomb on my Sylvanas and couple of other small mistakes   I played much better and win was inevitable even with his luck  which is only right  and this happens which made me lost at the end  Not sure if I should post this in salt thread or cool screenshots thread  guy got a goddamn Coldarra Drake and won based on pure RNG while getting outplayed the whole match  Cool screenshot to see but painful to lose to worse players    I was always up for some RNG since it
