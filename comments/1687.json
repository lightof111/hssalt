that shit run on ladder for months until sales of the new expansion start to slow  then they might nerf it  NEVER give Blizzard money for cards  you are being conned  You might be able to ride a strong cancer deck for a month or three  but the nerfs will come and new cancer will arise to soak up more money  The idea of building a collection of playable cards or decks is a giant con  What do I see in standard at rank 15  Quest Rogue  Quest Warrior  Quest Mage  the occasional Elemental Shaman or Paladin  GIANT CON  BULLSHIT GAME  This expansion sucks just like Brode\", \"commentId\":
