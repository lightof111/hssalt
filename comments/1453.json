"[{\"comment\": \"I actually agree  this pirate warrior and shaman thing has to stop now  this game is the worst ive seen it  ever  its all combo and aggro  and wild mode     dont even get me started there      cough nerf freeze mage  secret pali seriously blizzard has fucked up  they go and nerf abusive sergeant and leper gnome to weaken aggro  then create patches  buckaneer and make aggro the

 at any high rank all of the games are against the tier 12 decks with ZERO variation  My average time to make a play and average game length are dramatically below my average  I routinely sit there with a card in my hand and play it the second its my turn because A I know exactly what the opponent is going to play and B you either play on curve and immediately answer their play or you lose  so you dont actually have decisions to make  This is at legend last season and a 70 win rate so far this season  And then you get the rare fun matchups against Control Warrior or a Reno deck    and you win or lose based on the luckier dirty rat   Its just a zero skill meta  It really is  I say this not because I havent been successful  again  legend last season and pretty easily on pace this season but because its just a dice generator meta  Theyre smorc and you got Reno in the mulligan You win  Theyre Rogue and get fairly lucky They win  They dirty rat out a critical card They win  You dirty rat out a critical card You win  Boring  pointless games\", \"commentId\": \"30486\", \"commentDate\": \"1483559686\"}, {\"comment\": \"Now imagine something  If leper gnome and abusive were not

the board as I have a 3 attack minion on board  Dragonfire potion providing they get anything with 8 health or less and I can stabalize from there Rogue has 1 card in hand  Paletress gives him a Chromaggus which I cannot kill  I Dragonfire anyway to clear the rest of the board so I can live  Chromaggus goes off and gives the Rogue two copies of Stonetusk Boar  Chromaggus 6  Boar 1  Boar 1
