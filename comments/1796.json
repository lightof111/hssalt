are PROGRAMED to make the consumer grind for monetary purposes   So Balanced  whether characters  cards   weapons etc   actually means forced to pay to win now  until we balance it out again for you to P2W again later   Its in this constant cycle where Blizzard is able to make its billions in the name of balance for all players  beautiful  The balance model involves draws  RNG  match ups and of course the expansions  The promise of a better and balanced game means get the lube out cause the fleece is coming  If you take their BS with a grain of salt  the less likely you will find yourself
