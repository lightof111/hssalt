for 2 fucking years\", \"commentId\": \"24154\", \"commentDate\": \"1471215647\"}, {\"comment\": \"Its a deck that has two major things that make people view it as hard  a It is a different deck to pretty much any in HS  so it takes time to adjust to playing it and people thus think its harder than it is similar to the public perception of maths  and b Its a deck where small misplays can easily lose you the game a few turns down the road  Using the wrong freeze example  do you use a blizzard and pop that shreddercreeperegg Or use the nova and not play around Loatheb a few turns down the line Whats the likelihood of you needing that Lance for lethal instead of using it to freeze that nerubian from an Egg you just popped  not playing around every hate card going for Alex too early and getting eateredloathebed or not drawing enough burn  dropping a Doomsayer when its not required late and getting killed by Boom     overreliance on ice block  misjudging when youre unlikely to get an Alex off and thus need to switch to an early burn face to lethal  misjudging Emperor  misjudging the reach andor burst likely available to the opponents deck and thus freezing too early or too late  misjudging the burst healing available to your opponent      Hate it for being an uninteractive deck  certainly  Probably not a good deck to have in a game without instantspeed interaction or some discard  Hate it for stalling out the game when theres quicker routes to victory  but a handful of possible scenarios where going for the Alex early leaves the mage weak to hate  But theres many decks that are powerful even when youre on autopilot or not playing well  Great example Zoo  I played some undertaker zoo myself  and after I switched away from it  I was seeing so many misplays from the zoo players  Minor ones  but still a lot  Some blatant  some less so  Misplays that the zoo players rarely got punished for\", \"commentId\": \"24155\", \"commentDate\": \"1471216820\"}, {\"comment\": \"Before this weekend id argue with you  that its a 5050 RNG play  so not that powerful  That was until I bitthebullet and crafted our lord and saviour YoggSaron  Hopes End  I randomly slotted him into my tempo warrior deck and with only 58 spells played he created some insane results  id say around 7080 of the times he shifts the game in my favour  That is completely Over Powered   In one game he clears a Call of the Wild board from my opponent and then plays it for me  all in 78 spells  Another notiable moment was a 3 spell Yogg of Healing Touch my face  Effigy and Mark of Nature on himself taunt of course  Oppoent spends all resources clearing YoggSaron  Hopes End just to be met with YShaarj  Rage Unbound  This card is SO unfair    when playing against it\", \"commentId\":
