has already burgled a couple of times and he plays a secret  OF COURSE  I just know its ice block because they always get that  He has the 1616 still on board and I have 14 health and I have a blizzard and doomsayer still in hand plus ice block  I figure maybe I can still get lucky and pop his ice block before he pops mine  I play blizzard and his secret is counter fucking spell  I just got

like Rogue or Warrior  you have such a disadvantage  Its seriously annoying when you lose to 1 card  even tho youve done everything you can to outplay your opponent  Such skill  much amaze  wow\",

you  What I always do in such a situation is look at metastats net and Vicious Syndicates data reaper live  plus my own observation of my recent games  and try to assess what Im seeing a lot and how I could counter that  Its still a shot in the dark  but at least its less dark that way  Alternatively  if youre going for the grind  pick a deck that has no inherently bad matchups overall  and stick with that  Youll get into the groove of playing it and your winrate will increase if you persist  Trying to alternate between specific counter decks can backfire pretty hard  just read back this
