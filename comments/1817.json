deck contents I hope somebody actually brings a class action suit against them for misleading business practice  I also hope every fucking moron who has posted tinfoil hat confirmation bias if you are

druidx2  then perfect curve pirate warriorx2  dragon priest I instantly conceded when paired with priest for backtoback games WTF is that Blizzard   so on this bad streak of luck I decide to burn down my pity timer  so 10 packs later I get Lorewalker Cho     so that was a perfect ending to perfect day where I got my wisdom tooth pulled out by dentist  Fuck you very much too Blizzard  you just lost
