"[{\"comment\": \"Quoted for truth  Take pride in your rank  it means something  People riding those socalled meta decks are not necessarily better players if they end up high on the ladder  and they are certainly shitty players if they dont make at least rank 5  I know people playing pirate warrior and Jade Shaman who tell me they are rank 5 best they have ever done  I just laugh  Rank with those decks is a mark of how shit you are  not even legend with those decks means much  Entire season ruined so Blizzard could sell broken cards and idiots paid for them\", \"commentId\": \"34153\",
