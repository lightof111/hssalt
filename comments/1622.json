"[{\"comment\": \"I disagree with thispeople are not forced to play a specific archetype by any other archetypebut I will acknowledge that this meta does resemble a very restrictive rockpaperscissors   Sort of accurate  but not completely  Enter dragon priest  In fact  as a Jade Druid player you may loathe me now my toughest matchup is not pirate warrior I have a winrate far above 50 against them with minor techingits dragon priest  If I dont ramp up and hit jades when I need to  a dragon priest hitting curve outboards me easily  Thats not rush  its midrange board control   Sadly  I agree  I do enjoy playing jade druid and I wouldnt call this deck cancer Im reluctant to call any deck that as I think we should be very considerate when using that word in the first place but objectively I see your point  I think a nerf in one way or another to the jade idol is the obvious solutionI wouldnt mind if the winrate versus control skews towards a 5050 with control decks for jades\",

this game  He did that  played some cards until getting the combo and won the game  He didnt need to think about trades  value  tempo    anything  Just  I need to draw those cards and thats it  That was I meant about did nothing in the game  And even if you say but he needs to manage to survive to get the combo    Cmon  is not that hard to do that  Just wipe out the board with some AOE and cure himself if its necessary  And I was not pissed about draws  Its a card game  that happens all the time I know HS is not the more skilled CCG available around there  but the others games are so boring

it is  maybe it isnt my gut says a swingy control deck with NZoth or Deathwing or the LeeroyFacelessPO combo of Renolock at the end could push out a lethal 12 endgame turns that kills jade druid
