agree with you  I also think  that just because some cards are rotating out to wild soon  that doesnt mean  that they shouldnt get a balance change  Its a terrible thought  that shoveling them to wild will change anything  It wont First of all  thats really lazy and secondly kinda unprofessional from the devs  if they really wanted to make wild fun for all  they should make some nerfs  Cards like those will ruin the game experience for others  especially for newer players  Why dump everything broken in a format  just to be mixed in a bigger abomination and scare people from ever playing
