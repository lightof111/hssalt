deck in the game against hunters  but still  Not many classes can deal with that  The only one I can think of is mages with flamestrike  And even then  no mage deck runs double of flamestrike so they pretty much lose the moment the hunter drops his second CotW\", \"commentId\": \"25950\", \"commentDate\": \"1473985122\"}, {\"comment\": \"blizzard please implement bans in casual   i am fucking sick

luck   disappointment  fairness for me right now  even if I am seeing some pretty terrible shit in arena tonight    Instead I wanna say  far too often I just cant help myself  Have been playing for a while but still  similar to how sometimes people are too late getting out of the thinking mode of value trading minions or controlling the shit out of the board  not seeing less obvious lethal    too often I just forget how a class like rogue ought to be played  just tempo and aggro efficiently  and I feel as if I will be punished if I dont tend to the board  But then go overboard using the face to kill minions to dominate the board  It can be so bad that I just bust myself doing that  and Im still getting outvalued by threats  But if I hadnt attacked minions wouldnt it have been even worse
