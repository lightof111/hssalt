\"Im actually astonished  The last few games Ive been playing pirate warrior  Yes  thats incredibly disgusting from me and I do not feel even the slightest pride because of doing so  I just played it because I was sick of jade druids  and wanted to maybe understand the deck better so I can combat it better  But the average pirate warrior is SO FUCKING AWFUL  Im not kidding they are actually dogshit bad  I knew they are worse than the average player  but I thought people saying they were retarded were just joking  So Ive beaten every other pirate warrior Ive met  Even though I had pretty crappy starting hands against most especially the last one  I drew double upgrade and he a perfect curve  Pirate warriors dont know that the pirate mirror is a tempo matchup  They just go face like retards  doing shit like not even trading their Fiery War Axe into my 33 Bloodsail Raider  And WHEN they trade its always wrong  last game for some reason someone decided to trade into my 32 Acidic Swamp Ooze with his Arcanite Reaper even though the only way he could possibly still win that match was by rushing me down  What is going on Pirate warrior is the easiest deck in the game yet they SOMEHOW manage to screw up everything theyre doing  And these are people whove hit rank 5 yet belong in the tutorial  Ive actually just lost a whole lot more respect for pirate warriors  which is astonishing aswell because there wasnt a whole lot to begin with\", \"commentId\": \"33711\", \"commentDate\": \"1489573908\"}, {\"comment\": \"There is absolutely ZERO tempo in hearthstone anymore
