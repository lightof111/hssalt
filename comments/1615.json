together and is a good player when you see that card back  Now Nah  I know better  Alls it means is that they latched onto the cancer of the day deck and went on a lucky run  Those are the facts  From about rank ten on down    the player base is the same skill level  Its just decks at that point  You cant misplay when a deck plays itself for you  If the game were skill based then any deck could get you a high rank but we know thats not true  Fact\", \"commentId\": \"33926\", \"commentDate\": \"1490088179\"}, {\"comment\": \"Climbed to rank 8 for a change  Which is decent for my fundecks   But
