freeze you know youve lost but you have to sit there and watch yourself die over an eternity since your minions are always dead or frozen with nothing you can do but watch and cry  Is screwing around

e perhaps you have some healing in there e g a Reno Jackson to use after hes used soem of his burn  or a secret tech weapon like Secret Eater to screw him over  Ragnaros is great too for obvious reasons   if you dont have any of these things and you know from turn 1 that youre screwed then I completely agree you cant do anything about it Literally because your minions are frozen and its just pointless   Even then  I probably prefer that to tempo mage\", \"commentId\": \"25523\", \"commentDate\": \"1473256994\"}, {\"comment\": \"Not really salt  but funny story   Decided to try out Prince

game would be RNG based but RNG means RANDOM  not always in my opponents favor  Lost 12 games in a row again  none where I look back and say I shouldnt have played this way So bad players can reach

is such a good deck even literally braindead people can be successful with it  just played against the worst player I have ever seen  the dude played a turn 1 fiery bat  into coin  into end turn

barely win the game  but I was at 3hp  to all midrange hunter players  if someone playing their first ever game of hearthstone can be fairly successful with your deck  you should already be at legend rank if youre not a complete retard  just stop infesting the lower ranks and get to legend already so the rest of us can enjoy hearthstone  thank you\", \"commentId\": \"25526\", \"commentDate\":

druid deck  This is what annoys me in HS atm  relying on rng yogg when your health is at 1  Great    and typical Cthun druid Its really really boring to play with and against  If people verse me in casual with that  Ill literally BM you really bad  I want to go against innovative and creative decks  Idc how many times I lose  I lost all yday because I was experimenting with Rogue decks  Seems like Rogue is really damn weak and with cool combos  its a shame since it has alot of potential\", \"commentId\": \"25532\", \"commentDate\": \"1473262829\"}]"
