"[{\"comment\": \"Even mage is jumping on the smorc bandwagon apparently  Where has all the fun in hearthstone gone seriously  If I play against a mage who just goes Fireball 2x  Frostbolt  Firelands Portal 2x for 25 damage  hero power during the match in a few turns  wtf are we supposed to against this   Just sad how the entirety of this game has become focussed on just winning as fast as possible and with as little as possible thinking required  Still stuck at 10  0 stars since I can just keep conceding whenever warrior or druid comes up  Boring lame decks\", \"commentId\": \"34028\",

shitty deck  not good for ranked  It has been quite succesful  not completely dependant on the burgle value  But Im not salty about the issue of dying at turn 8  which is longer than usual vs pirate warriors  But Im more concerned with the mindset behind the plays  I am busy building board control making tough choices  Whilst I can see the opponent mage considering killing that one large minion or just going face and hope for the best  Added is the fact that his hand was empty save for some mirror image  Which means he just went face  like pirate warrior with the hopes of drawing the next spell to blast face with for three consecutive turns  I know I dont have a lot of right to be salty here  But still the spells to the face were just a big wtf moment to me   Like ok I had rogue  warrior  shaman  priest going face  But now mage too xD Also apologies for the abundance of posts in this thread once again  But the thread serves its purpose to me personally \", \"commentId\":

games generally last past turn 10  You should have plenty of time to set up your own plays and react to your opponent  Ive played against a lot of jade Druids and  aside from the redundancy have never had any real issue with them  Its the face decks where all you can do is react to your opponents plays and pray for specific cards where there is little interaction\", \"commentId\": \"34034\",
