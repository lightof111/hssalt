correct  but as a card  old undertaker outshines small time buccaneer  And patches or buccaneer are really good cards  but they will always stay 32 and 11  And of course  old huntertaker had also accesss to the unnerfed aggro minions Leper Gnome  Knife Juggler and Arcane Golem  plus the carddraw of starving buzzard and unleash the hounds for a hand refill  Edit And I forgot the 2 mana silence against taunt  I admit that a  comparison is a little bit unfair since huntertaker had so many cards which have been nerfed for good reasons  but I am convinced that the old huntertaker deck was in the top 3 of the most powerful deck in hearthstone history and way stronger than pirates are now and it was a much bigger part of the meta  I personally played Jade shaman in the last season midrange and I had much more problems with aggressive rogues than with warrior\", \"commentId\": \"31833\", \"commentDate\": \"1486061546\"}, {\"comment\": \"Fucking shitgame this is  My opponent plays Burgle

slightly favored to warrior  but still  not drawing fiery war axe for turn 2 also greatly reduces pirate warriors potential  and so does not drawing buccaneer  Naturally  not drawing undertaker was worse news to hunter than it was not drawing buccaneerwar axe  but even then  hunter had 21 Leper Gnome  Mad Scientist  Misha and Huffer  Highmanes they had so explosive early play they could even play late game OP card  sometimes Loatheb or even Sludge  It is winnable for pirate warrior  but if it does not manage to steamroll hunter for turn 23  is fucking lost no matter what  Also  huntertaker  even with the best 1drop ever invented\", \"commentId\": \"31836\", \"commentDate\": \"1486062446\"}, {\"comment\": \"druid and rogue hero power auctioner  the most unbalanced card
