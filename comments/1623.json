against druid there  And Lightbomb simply kills their jade army  But Pirate Warriors can go to hell  burn there impaled on a stick rammed from their hole through their mouth  And yes  Jade Druid in Standard is a big issue why is Jade druid only tier 3 then Simply because control decks no longer exist  And for them we have YARRRRRRRR YARRRRRRR YARRRRRRR YARRRRRRRR YARRRRRRRRR Pirrrrrrrrrrratestone  Jade idol was the most stupid card blizzard ever released  It killed Control in Standard Hopefully it get nerfed  but i doubt it because the average Team 5 Employee is lazy as

good cards  The ONLY reasons I won were because I was playing as Mage  and had a bunch of spells I could burn  That and my secret polymorphed one of her draw murlocs  Also  I drew a card that dealt two damage to one of her draw murlocs  Actually  Prince Malchezaar probably saved my ass  more than anything  by padding my deck more   I thankfully drew a Roaring Torch  with two minions on board  That was enough to kill her  Being salty  I said Thank You after I drew the roaring torch and killed her with it  I get there there is a lot of calculation that goes into a lot of deck types  You have to know what youre doing  It just irritates me that those decks rely on the other player fatiguing  It just seems so uninspired to me  No disrespect intended to those that play Mill Rouge  I just got done playing against one  so I am freshly irritated\", \"commentId\": \"34077\", \"commentDate\": \"1490331025\"}, {\"comment\": \"Thats just nonsense  I play jade druid and never even owned

not just because they exploit ridiculous card synergies  not just because this game is ruined by OP rampant netdecking at all levels  not just because Blizzards cash grab money cycle is so blatantly obvious  not just because half the sad sad desperate little fucks playing those decks either emoted shit or dragged out lethal  not just because Ben Brode couldnt work out how to get a fuck in a
