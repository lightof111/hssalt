player said the matchup are adjusted specially for you with player with similar collection and similar winrate  After enough game you should reach a win rate around 50  Extra gold is better spent on classic packs at the beginning until you get most good commons  the good rare  try avoid crafting anything apart for epics and legendary because you gonna get the cards anyway  Once you get all the common from classic starting buy from the last expansion or adventure After some games at least a few hundred you can try some arena  I recommend you use the site heartharena to choose the best cards  3 games gives you the same value as 150 gold spent on packs  so after 10 arena examine your results  If you are below 3 win average it is better for you to buy packs directly  rinse in repeat until you get the cards and dust to craft a viable ranked deck 2 You are polarized on playing ranked Salt  Find the absolute cheapest meta aggro deck look for budget pirate warrior or something like that dust all the cards not concerned and craft the deck  play hard and git gut  buy packs as the come and dust everything until you have the meta deck full  3 general advice Most of the people on rank 20 to 15 are low skill players lack of cards  experience  consistency  reflexion and can be beaten with a reasonably powerful deck just by outplaying them  Dont be impressed by a guy playing legendary rank 18 middle of the season  he can outplayed  When winning try to understand why did you win  I drew like a god guy made a misplay ect  etc  if You lost try to understand why even harder  did I misplayed was there a card stuck in my hand which I could no use I did not play around AOE etc  At the beginning you probably wont see the real reason why you lost but it is a good habit to take  Many lost start 45 or 10 turns before you actually lose the game  Best if you can record them for reexamination Use your time and think before you play  you have 1 minutes  Use it If you are serious you can watch streamer on twitch I watched a lot a lifecoach at the beginning If you are in a limited play time try to stick to two or three class maximum  When crafting epic and legendary focus on classic and last expansion  dont waste you dust on gimmicky cards  q Salt is Gewd\", \"commentId\": \"32037\", \"commentDate\": \"1486541600\"}, {\"comment\": \"i wonder if this piratemeta causes

the main chess piece in any Mill Rogue and with Gang Up rotating out  it will be dead in standard The art of milling from turn 1 to when you die of fatigue is just one huge performance and show off of the mill players skill  He is figuratively iceskating graciously backwards and making pirouettes as he perfectly times the coldlight brann gang up shadowstep or prep vanish play  It needs a lot for a Mill Play to successfully develop  The mill play is like a cascade of different reactions that are the requirement for the mill to keep on going  The requirements are much stricter than the ones in Miracle when you want to search through your deck  You dont only need to search through deck  but also through coldlights and certain cards that you are missing  You also need to uphold the current milled hand state  I can understand that it is not easy for you and it annoys you if you get milled  but you losing to mill is a due to a good starting hand of the miller and b of the skill it takes to pilot this wonderful deck  When the miller is at low health and can successfully maneuver his Reno to heal him to 30 while he also had removed his ganged up coldlights  then the spectacle has rounded up  Your complaint is in my opinion unjustified  as this rare play doesnt succeed consistently early enough to be viable\", \"commentId\": \"32043\", \"commentDate\": \"1486557774\"},

the point where you either chose to be an aggrodeck or a renodeck  With so little room for innovative decks to be viable as well  I even preferred metas such as the undertaker one to this one  That was just 1 deck being more powerful than others  Here they created a coinflip 5050 meta  5050 as in you either face AggroJadePirate shaman  pirate warrior  pirate rogue or renopriest  renomage or renolock  In the last 16 games I literally faced three different heroes  2 different decktypes   And ofcourse as I type this  an aggro shaman opponent T1 Spirit Claws  Tunnel Trogg coined out  At this point I just concede for stuff like this  To be clear  I dont care if I win or lose at all  Its just so infuriating that Hearthstone starts to lack more and more originality in the game somehow  Even
