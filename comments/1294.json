down to 6 hp while I was full   Plays Sylvanas   Next turn plays brawl   My buffed Curator survives brawl and he takes it with with Sylvanas   GG right there   If he took any of my other cards or if his survived I win the game   Busted card   Its bad enough warrior gets a lot of cheap and easy ways to remove cards but giving them a cheap board wipe with pretty much no downside is total garbage and Im really tired of losing games to otherwise bad decks just because of this one card   The worst part is that its part of the classic set so its never getting rotated out   Flame strike is a flat 4 damage and costs 7 mana   Twisting Nether is a total board wipe for 8   Why is Brawl freaking 5  Whos bright freaking idea was that\", \"commentId\": \"27151\", \"commentDate\": \"1476941688\"},
