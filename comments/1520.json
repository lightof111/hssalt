Once per game  if the effect is going to be that ridiculous   Every Reno deck mirror is based on who high rolls their Brann  Kazakus  with some extra clown fiesta for pulling a CourierSoulcaster  Kazakus out of your ass   And while hyperaggro just loses to one potion  dealing with one almost impossible to play around potion is bad enough for a midrange or nonReno control deck two might as well just combine into one well skilled  you win the game card   I suppose Brann is rotating soon  but some absurd effects shouldnt exist for any period of time\", \"commentId\": \"31926\",

Reno Mage  I decided to give it a whirl on Wild  specially when you consider the awesome Deathrattles in there  Around Rank 15  I faced a Shaman  Heres how the game goes My turn 1  I pass  his turn 1 he goes Tunnel Trogg  Turn 2  I ping it and he goes Totem Golem  Im at 28  My turn 3  I go with Deathlord  He goes Flametongue Totem and kills my Deathlord  pulling out the Flamewreathed Faceless  Im sad  but I still have a plan  If I hold out till turn 7  I can Flamestrike and eventually regain control of the match  My turn 4  I begin to see the light  because my top deck is Sludge Belcher to help me stall  I play my Piloted Shredder  He goes face with his minions and im at 16  then he summons his other Faceless  from the left side of his hand  which means my Deathlord pulled his ONLY Faceless in his deck in the pool of standard Aggro Shaman small minions    but its fine  I still have a chance if he doesnt pull off more insane opening shenanigans Im really trying not to fill my sentences with curse words here  My turn 5  I play the Belcher and decide to kill the totem golem  hoping for something like Doomsayer  And i get Annoyotron  That is a good 2drop I have 2 Taunts that require 4 attacks to be killed And since he only has 2 attacks and is overloaded  my plan CAN work Nope  he has a Spirit Claws and now Im left with a 12 taunt against that gigantic board that got healed because he rolled Healing Totem lol  eventually dying next turn   And heres the 2 sad parts of this story 1 Even if I were to Reno  I would gain 1 extra turn tops  No  I didnt have it  2 The dudes name was NeverLucky  Really  perfect opener that allows you to not waste any mana crystal without need to use your coin  Deathlord pulling out the one huge minion in your deck and youre NeverLucky Can this game be any more ironic Oh right  the game ended my win streak  so yeah  it can  I dont really mind aggro itself  but boy it can be a bitch sometimes\", \"commentId\": \"31928\",

together  play a few games and see how they go  make some adjustments and try again  Keep going till they get something interesting that works okay  You are correct  I have no respect for people who go Im going to play Reno Mage or  Dragon Priest today whats the top deck list for them Im salty because I have a homebrew warloc thats stuck in potato ranks because it dies to Reno and my last 6 games have been Fibs control warrior  Renoloc  and Reno Mage all running the exact same decklists  My attitude is maybe Ill build something Aggro then and see if I can climb that way  Your attitude is  build Pirate Warrior or Midrange Shaman  Everyone believing they have to netdeck is the reason the meta is so stale  that and ridiculous deck synergies that need a nerf\", \"commentId\": \"31932\",
