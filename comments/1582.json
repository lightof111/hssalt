times after that when the day before as my rogue deck  I fought it every second or third match\", \"commentId\": \"33244\", \"commentDate\": \"1488868288\"}, {\"comment\": \"I didnt want to do this but its gone out of hand    and since this is GROUP THERAPY  Id like to offer the THERAPY portion    First of  okay    Good job venting it off no sarcasm here  BUT sometimes    please realize that your saltiness and pessimism has become quite toxic  TBH  Ive ignored your posts so I dont see them when I am loggedin    but when I am not loggedin  I see them  Sometimes  just swallow a chill pill and take your games as it is    you win some games  you lose some games    but thats Hearthstone or any kind of PvP game in particular    point is you cant win them all  it might be due to misplays or not drawing what you need    or the opponent drawing perfectly    but thats Hearthstone  you cant win it all    Second  pessimism gets you nowhere even in real life    but to take Hearthstone as an example  the moment you become pessimistic and tilt  chances are the more mistakes and misplays you make  which makes it look like your opponent won through sheer luck and they deserve it and you dont even when it doesnt seem as such  The more you say you dont deserve to win  the more that you dont win    think of it as a selffulfilling prophecy    Third  balance your saltiness with pepperiness     Dude  Im sure that you had your lucky and fun moments too  I mean    why focus and post only the bad stuff when you can also share the good stuff    and dont tell us that youre the most unlucky person in Hearthstone    youre Rank 15 atm dunno you might have ranked up so it shows that you dont lose all your games and thus  the most unlucky person  Lastly  at the end of the day Hearthstone is just a game that I think you love playing    I mean  if you hated it so much you wouldve stopped playing weeksmonths ago and thus  stopped posting on the Salt thread  but youre still posting  which means you still lovelike the game    and I dont know for you the purpose of the game is to have fun  Yes  you enjoy making your own decks  climbing with decks that are fun in your case    dont let anyone using a Pirate deck or Shaman deck ruin it for you    at the end of the day they are also having fun their own way  whether you like it or not    what Im saying is  your definition of fun and their definition of fun might be different    but dont let their definition of fun ruin your fun  and dont expect them to adapt your definition of fun  Im not saying that you shouldnt post here    like I said  it is a good avenue to let off steam    in fact its perfectly fine to post here thats why this salt thread was created    but sometimes when you spam posts after every game  it becomes toxic    Anyway man  enjoy the game  If my therapy didnt help  then Im sorry  P TLDR  I am someone whom someone would call a Fuckwit too lazy to find the post in this thread because I offered advise to a salty person    lol\", \"commentId\": \"33245\", \"commentDate\": \"1488872637\"}, {\"comment\": \"Played against several priests and all of them had at least one entomb  Not to mention many of them ran
