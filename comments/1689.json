"[{\"comment\": \"I think the quests mechanic is ruining this game   Almost all of them are retardedly easy to complete  and usually once they complete the quest you cant win   I have now lost 6 games in a row to decks that play a quest  and in every game theyve completed by turn 5 or 6 poor guy   Theres just no way to stop them when they complete their quest   I used to enjoy playing this game  now I find myself getting more and more pissed at it when I do play   Unless blizz does something soon  this may be my last expansion that I play in   If I could sell my cards to somebody  I think I would and just move on\", \"commentId\": \"35433\", \"commentDate\": \"1492304773\"}, {\"comment\": \"The friends list\", \"commentId\": \"35434\", \"commentDate\": \"1492307274\"}, {\"comment\":

by turn six  I finish my quest and play Hemet on turn seven ready to throw down queen and fill up my deck  This guy plays the spell card that allows him to adapt all of his minions on the board and he get Windfury  I have 5  health left after that so I play queen then manage to adapt her so she has taunt  Even if she dies his minions cant kill me and I can regain board control right Nope  this guy has the second adapt spell card and wouldnt you know it  he gets poisonous  Sacrifice the 44 and win the game  grats on the rng   Next game I was playing while typing this I manage to pull off the combo against an exodia mage who has blown two freeze novas and a Blizzard already and is down to 8 health  My router decides its a good time to take a nap for the first time in a month and the rest

such a bad card in your deck  Remember when they nerfed freeze mage back in beta because it was too uninteractive Blizzard up from 5 to 6 mana  Cone of Cold I think too  Now they give them an infinite
