5  Play 10 games of each aggro pirate warrior  druid  murloc paladin and hunter  Opponent always clear my board  Ungoro supposed to make things better but I only see it make things worse  Before Ungoro release  control match up still has chance with Reno Jackson  Now you lose board mean you fing lose the game  Why bother to play a game where I spend thousands dollar just to make myself worse  And none of the money spend has ROI value  I spend and make myself salty  No F thanks Blizzard\", \"commentId\": \"38069\", \"commentDate\": \"1495809670\"}, {\"comment\": \"Had full board control

good bye to you guys and to this wonderful salty thread  I have played this game since the beta  3 years ago  and its time for me to move on  This game was fun in the first year and became really bad for the years after  filled with RNG  BMing Kids and Blizzard stupid card design  prices and balance   I have realised  yesterday that I am just launching this game out of habit  I win 10 games then lose 30 Rank 43 every season  I am not a bad player because I am playing against gods among men with incredible luck and top decks or blizzard keeps queuing me against unfavourable classes when I am on a win streak until I lose 3 or more stars  I had enough of this bullshit  Yesterday I was on a winstreak with an OTK priest I made  lost like 4 games in a row vs quest rogues  I got salty but thats fine  then the last match before I lost my shit was vs a hunter  here is how it went Turn 2 he coins out a Vicious Fledgling and I answer with Shadow Word Pain Turn 3 he plays another Vicious Fledgling and I play Radiant Elemental and I Knew that it was over if he has Houndmaster Turn 4 he plays two Crackling Razormaw and gives it 6 attack  so now he has 93 Vicious Fledgling  he attacks face and gets windfury of course then stealth of course I am at 12 health on turn 4    I put down a Tortollan Shellraiser I know that I lost but I didnt concede because I was so mad and was just cursing the whole time before this match even started  Turn 5 he trades both Crackling Razormaw attacks once with Vicious Fledgling gets stealth again but he doesnt attack the 2nd time  I thought that he forgot to attack    Turn 6 turns out he is just BMing  he plays two Kill Command on my face then I just conceded  This is just a sample of the games I lose  this isnt fun and I feel like shit even if I won that match  I have played this game for 3 years and I have never had this kind of nuts hands that my opponents keep having most of the time  Fuck Hearthstone  I made the right choice to uninstall and move on  I dont need this game in my life\", \"commentId\": \"38074\", \"commentDate\": \"1495810812\"}, {\"comment\": \"Cant draw or mulligen any of the 6 1 drops in my deck to save my
