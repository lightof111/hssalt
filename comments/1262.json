"[{\"comment\": \"You know what  Hearthstone is perfectly fine balance wise  The problem of hearthstone is its greedy community of assholes looking to abuse decks invented by some famous prick  People playing HS have no idea what fun is  all everybody looking for is jacking off to their legendary status which means jackshit and literally zero people give fucks about you having it  except for inflated egos of those who play aggro shaman  dragon warrior et cetera et cetera  Hearthstone is not a game anymore  its a circlejerk fiesta of people looking to accomplish something in their lives without doing anything  so they go here  get a shitty deck requiring zero thought and get their legendary  I love the game  fuck the community of it though\", \"commentId\": \"26476\",
