like big legendary cards  because its a better game experience to drop deathwing  ysera  famous charachters from lore  then put down a troggzor or korkon elitewhat a shame cardDD   Never played aggro  couse I want to play tactical games  not facerush   Thats why I never reached legend  Maybe someone can reach legend with control games  better players and maybe play more time  but I surely know that a pirate warrior is not better player than me  I make decisions  they just go faceD I exactly know that this meta is the best chance to reach legend first  in a very easy way  play pirate warrior or aggro shaman  I just dont wanna spend time to play decks what I dont like  and race with the mana curve to not reach a healer or boardclear oportunity  I just wanted to write down my feelings about
