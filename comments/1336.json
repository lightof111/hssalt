tunnel trog fallowed by another one then comes Flametongue totem or Lightning Bolt and a Totem Golem and if even if you are able to remove something of it say hello to the Feral Spirits      Its like shamans would only run these 45 cards in there deck BUT FUCK NO its a fucking 30 Card game im not that good at math but what are the fucking odds that i didnt met one single shaman that didnt curved
