works well in Midrange  but it isnt really necessary  Biggest advantage is if you can play it on curve  Infested Wolf  Tundra Rhino  Highmane  Swamp King  your opponent will quickly run out of answers  But anything poisonous can break tempo  But in most of the games I tried this card it actually locked down the game for my opponent and gave me huge tempo swings   At this point Casual is almost worse than Ranked  Im only encountering highlevel netdecks  On the plus side  theres a lot of variety  ElementalDeathrattle Priests  Elemental Paladins  Elemental Shamans  Taunt Warriors  Midrange Hunters  etc  Only decks that I really dont like at the moment are those Quest Rogues  Even Pirate Warrior is more manageable than Rogue at this point\", \"commentId\": \"36625\", \"commentDate\":

profiting from that shit Hero Power  Pirate warrior needs more thinking than this shit  and I am not commenting o Quest Rogue  completing quest on turn 4 playing it and on turn 5 I am death      cuz
