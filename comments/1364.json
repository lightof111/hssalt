just got to throw it out from yourself somehow  So quit the game  sure and ive done it but it has nothing to do with a diet  Why are people so annoyed when palying against shaman Because their hero power is pure 25 RNG  People hate loosing against tiny chances and bad odds because we feel as its not fair and every person has a feeling of justice  Its not about a game itself rly but about some1 fucking up the game youve enjoyed so much to play for 3 years but now you cant because some retarded team had to release fucktarded cards and playing it only makes your day worse as there are tactics involving COUNTING ON PURE LUCK which some braindead cocksuckers have to enjoy  And if you think thats not the best reason to get that salty then i dont know what is because the chance of those

can tell you before standartwild started I got legend playing secret palladin only from rank 1 to legend  Face shaman only from rank 4 to 3  All other matches I played deferent decks  I can tell you  when you play against a midrange deck you already know what to expect every single turn    just play a deck that counters this piece of midrange cra  Some stuff like reno decks or freeze mage   So I dont see a problem in winrates against tier 1 decks  Its just that your eyes become red of watching this turn 1 trogg into golem into coin summon 23 tounts  You start to think you played 10 or 20
