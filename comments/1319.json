shaman  zoolocks and discolocks  Fatigue warrior  most mages  NZoth paladins  thief priests and necromancer priests too  But none of them can come in pair to the feeling of despise I feel when I see a paladin throwing murlocs and always THAT 23 murlocs  Its like you play with a man and then you suddenly realize its the worst person in the entire planet  or your favorite character becoming th very

decided to give a few money to the game  in my opinion its better to give some money and play whatever you want wherever you want than grind in this game for hours when if you play 510 games you will end up mad  especially arena where 90 pick mage and have 999 removal but also ranked where you might squelch the retards but you will witness many MANY autistic plays and face tactics  the game itself is not balanced but also the community is really bad  the more famous and splashable is the game the more low iq and garbage people will play it  this morning i was playing against a mage i didnt mute him and he was spamming thats incredible while going face with everything he has all game  i friend him and i ask him his age he replies why does it matter     that automatically makes him like 1016 kid  i told him why he acts like this and behind the screen theres a real person youre mocking and that person may have real serious problems in his life and plays to relax not to break his nerves from a virgin kid mocking him  i said i will report him and idc if the report goes through or not and he replied that he will report me for harrassment      then i read something from a user here  it was saying that hearthstone is played by millions of players that it is likely to play against a criminal  a 10 yo kid  a president of a company anything is possible  and yeah he is right so the best thing you have to do is accept that you will play against people with brain of a fish and ignore them focusing only on your game or quit the game entirely\", \"commentId\": \"27679\", \"commentDate\":
