people making longwinded rants about their poor luck  youre in for a treat I    I swear  Im just cursed when it comes to video game RNG  No matter how many days I think to myself Dont worry  its just variance I cant help but have that feeling slowly sink in  about pointless the next game is  because something outside of my control is going to push the game to another loss  Now Im finally starting to feel it after weeks of literally CONSTANT terrible RNG rolls  I recorded my last 3 games after another 2 went terribly  one being what I would consider a fair loss  and the other being similarly decided by unfortunate circumstances  Taking out the boring superdetailed portions  the last 3 games I played  as dragon paladin  went as follows  Vs  Control Warrior I maintain board strongly entire game  They manage 4 board clears with two awkward revenge combos sub 12 health and two brawls one of which his minion won with a 18 chance  the other he won with a 5050 chance to clear Ysera  stabilizing at 7 health at the end game  with me managing a heavy board presence again as we reach the end of our decks  him ahead on fatigue but higher on health due to tank up  I have 3 cards decent answers to a strong legendary as well as the monkey  he has 3  He plays Golden Monkey which I answer easily  and the following turn he plays Deathwing  I concede  Roughly calculated a 2 chance to get Deathwing  Calculated  1 chance of loss if either of the brawls had failed and allowed me to perform the extra 7 damage  or if Deathwing had been the Legendary he needed to destroy my board and subvert my remaining answers in hand  Game Extra Fun Fact This player had been emote BMing for a large portion of the game  which made the extra emoting on playing Deathwing all the more insulting Remember to autosquelch  people  Unless you really  really like that sweet  sweet reverse BM and dont suspect yourself of having been cursed by some voodoo shit  Vs  Ramp Druid Strikingly similar  except this time I fail to draw dragon synergy until t6 even with hard mulligan for dragons  and early game minions  and 11 dragons in deck  Despite subpar minions  his slow plays have allowed me to take him down to 7 health by turn 10  He plays Aviana behind a taunt which I can kill  but not also reach Aviana  He follows with Brann Bronzebeard into Nefarian  Ragnaros the Firelord  and Blood of The Ancient One  following it up with a Forbidden Healing  bringing him out of range of lethal with that extra 12 health  I concede  Given him not getting the heal necessary from the 4 cards stolen  the possibility of me losing based on the number of useful healing paladin cards is 20  Adding the odds in of dragon synergy allowing me to deal the extra 7 I needed  4 2  Game Extra Fun Fact If he needed exactly Aviana Brann Bronzebeard and Nefarian by that point in the game Roughly  2 chance of loss Though  in fairness  I doubt he wouldnt have had other cards that wouldve gotten him out of that situation Vs  Tempo Mage Slow start on their end  I control board easily entire game  Most damage I take is incidental from pings given off by Flamewakers and Arcane Missiles  By t10  Ive complete control of the board  they sit at 6 health  myself at 12  Theyve cast the burn spells that would allow the three cards in their hand to be lethal  They play YoggSaron  Hopes End  with 11 spells played that game  One Unleash the HoundsBloodlust combo later  I concede  Assuming that Yogg would have trouble dealing 12 damage to my face with 6 resilient minion targets on the board  and neglecting a board clear taking out unleash  the odds of me dying to that Yogg can be placed at roughly 3 5  Game Extra Fun Fact All buff spells were applied to either Yogg  or the hounds  while all damage spells were applied directly to my minions I was left with 2 of the 6 remaining by the end of it What a Yogg Truly  Yogg  you are hopes end  I sure the fuck dont have any more at least\",

that  You ve got lethal against a retarded aggro shaman with your hipster control deck OFC YOU RE GOING TO FUCKING DC But for real  Wtf is wrong with blizzard  Aggro shaman dominating meta Lets give them a 9 damage for 1 mana  Zoolock is gaylord of ranks Lets give them a card that lets them draw endlessly and is a 1 mana drop  Wtf is wrong with them  I can design a deck that counters all meta control decks the few that there are  same with combo  But your midrange bullshit aggro is impossible to counter    Whats that You counter aggro shaman There you go  nice bit of dragon to your face  Whats that  You counter zoo There you go  dead on turn 8 to a midrange face hunter   Can they just make a format where aggro is banned\", \"commentId\": \"25723\", \"commentDate\": \"1473594313\"}, {\"comment\": \"I have something terrible with druids  I never really liked Blizzards druids  But there is one druid  one druid that I just cant take anymore  Stormrage    In WoW  fucking Malfurion spends most of the time doing absolutely nothing while everything else saves the Wild  the world  or that horned fucker  or dies in an attempt of saving him from his own stupidity  In Heroes of the Storm  whenever I find a Malfurion is a fucking moron who goes all DPS while letting me die when even a single tick from that fucking HoT he apparently forgets all the time can be casted on allies wouldve done the trick and save me  And of course  as Malfurion is no way a DPS hero  ends up doing bullshit  with the only remarkable action of letting other people who had no better choice than rely in him die  And then there is the Heartstone Malfurion  Maybe the most misserable of all druids  I bet if Xavius learned druidism the calss would actually be slightly less scumbag  Does not matter what you play as Malfurion  any sort of decent Malfurion deck died ages ago  I tried to see something positive in Malfurion  but finally killed my hopes funny how those Yogg druids have taken a big part on such a conclusion  Are you CThun Then youll curve your bullshit like a mootherfucker and poop out your ass unreal turns and ramps without any additional card draw  How can you consistently topdeck double Innervate  double Twilight Elder  double Dark Arakkoa  CThuns Chosen  double Swipe  Twin Emperor Veklor  CThun and some other drops depending on match Right  because Malfurion is a dick  If you happen to be a Yogg druid what has token become  jesus christ  then you just SMOrc like a madman with some bullshit tokenlike start  but the if opponent happens to control you  oh  suprise you play Gadgetzan Auctioneer and display a miracle that would leave the rogue equivalent naked and beaten to death in an abandoned road  with double Arcane GiantCard Name on top of it  And just in case somehow you still lose  Yogg Saron  Hopes End says hello You worthless piece of shit cant even imagine how to make a nonSMOrc beast druid even while having loads of awesome or even borderline broken drops for it  so you have to call a random rapist to give you that undeserved win you are always whining about  And of course  if you happen to be arena  you still a douchebag who curves out like a dream  SMOrcs the shit out of people and finish in a topdecked lame as fuck way while emoting like a beaten orphan whose soul had been crushed so many times you had already forgot forever what is to be apreciated by anything  Burn in hell  Malfurion  The only real thing Id be sad about your death is your wife who you didnt touch at all after 10000 years  Asshole  EDITED Was so mad I forgot how to english\", \"commentId\": \"25724\", \"commentDate\": \"1473595513\"}]"
