warrior    but what bugs me most is you defending ONiK midrange shaman  Sorry  I just cant see how play on curve  go face and let the other player make all the hard decisions is something to defend as a part of a healthy meta  Best meta ever had handlock  you just couldnt be stupid and succesful at the same time with handlock or at least very rarely  Even although I hated it at the beginning  it turned out to be the best control deck ver together with GvG midrangecontrol paladin  It actually even forced the opponent to think a bit and play around things  And its mere pressence was enough to favor the appearance of a wider variety of decks either for busting them  or for hunting handlock busters  not like some of the control decks we have right now cough  cough Jade Druid  cough  cough

or going face more often than trading with Karazhan midrange shaman  Not in my games  not on YouTube  not on Twitch  But maybe you can enlighten me and show me a clip where someone actually goes face with that deck   Karazhan mid shaman was one of the midrange decks that respect the definition of midrange  unlike some midrange hunter who kills you by turn 8  Mid shaman could be really fast sometimes  but also could be as slow as a control warrior depending on the matchup   Mid shaman was a curve deck Well  no  I agree that it had the early curve that every noncontrol shaman has trogg  totem golem and ferals  Also the thunder bluff on 7 can be considered a curve play  too  But thats it\", \"commentId\": \"31299\", \"commentDate\": \"1485089065\"}, {\"comment\": \"Youre one of the

use atleast 5 brain cells There are plenty of legit things to complain about for example the standard meta wich is dominated by 3 deck archetypes much much stronger then Secret Pally  But nooo lets keep bitching about the only viable Paladin Deck in Wild  A deck that is easily countered  Maybe you are also forgetting that Paladin is absolutely SHIT in standard right now  Blizzard hasnt released proper cards for this class for 2 expansions Oh and did I mention that said 3 archetypes are also absolutely dominating Wild aswellEspecially Pirate Warrior with his lethal in 35 turns  Idk if you are

Patches the other day and decided to see what the hubub was about with it seeing that this season I was playing mostly Jade Rouge and Reno Lock and was stuck at 18 with little movement  I literally climbed to rank 13 in an hour  with 90 of my games being done by turn 5 or 6  The only counter was if the opponent made it to turn 6 and was playing Reno  Its ridiculous that this deck is able to climb so easily and it takes out funinteractivity for both players  I really hope they fix it in some manner  ill be going back to decks that are actually fun  even if they lose me rank\",

face damage  thus giving it far more utility than it should have and fostering the shitty game play of hoarding a bunch of burst A dumb idea like fireball can only end in infuriating games where you topdeck lethal or you just happened to draw both for a 12 point burst  Dont be like Team 5 and avoid the incompetent idea of making spells that are way too good at two things\", \"commentId\":
