comparison before and will make it again Getting legend with a cancer deck is like losing your virginity to a prostitute  Yeah  you did it but we all know you dont deserve it  and anyone can do it  Its these cunts that made it so that the legend cardback is now worth NOTHING  No way to easily identify good players  All because some terrible players want to feel good so they picked cancer  Shaman
