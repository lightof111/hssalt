 looking for Priests  NOT A SINGLE ONE APPEARS  and the moment I switch to a deck thats weak against it  they just suddenly fucking appear Although everyone knows here already how well balanced my luck and sanity is  let me summarize just this Brawl experience 1  I see a lot of Priests  I go Renolock to counter  I literally only face godcurve Jade Druids  2  I pick Rogue to counter Druids and potentially Priests  I only face Aggro decks  Zoo  Warrior  Shaman  and Rogues  3  Okay  lets pick Shaman to have an allaround good matchup against everything except Priests  and boom  only Priests come with perfect 12345 turns  I cant even roll a single spellpower or draw Flametongue  of course because Im a horrible player compared to all these gods  4  Lets not forget and appreciate again the fact that all my opponents had insane starts according to their classes best possible earlygame  5  Apparently  everyone besides me had some easier first few games  met some newer people with worse decks  that is normal I suppose  Whats not normal is why didnt I face a single one of them Even at 12  full constructed deck against me  which just happened to counter mine  This is not funny  this just mindblowingly sad this this thing can happen to anyone  and that anyone happens to be exactly me   The combined chance of all these little RNG elements happening against my favor is so unreal  an infinite loop of high chances lost after one another without even a little break  I am cheated out of my moneygold and my sanity  I see everyone going 12 with so horrible mistakes  and I cant even get to a few wins without getting absolutely blown out by both matchup and ingame RNG  and by my own extremely shit draws  And not just the Brawl  the same has been happening for months everywhere else too  I am well aware of the minds different reaction to positive and negative inputs  how we undervalue the positive ones  but this is way beyond that  Im losing my shit so much  what have I done to deserve this I never harmed or cheated anyone in my life  nor have I attempted to gain advantage over someones loss I know this is just a game and should therefore be treated as one  but it doesnt change the fact that my analytical and logical mind cannot comprehend what shouldnt be possible  I am not a smart one in terms of general knowledge  so this is like taking away the one thing Im better at  the logic behind things  I did lie though  when I said I wouldnt write here again a month ago  because there is no lower  I cannot get saltier or unluckier  I have to promise this again  I would probably even delete this account if I knew how  so feel free to point me in the right direction  It will be disappointing to look back at all my rants later  so its better if I just remove my possibility to write here again Guess you will have to do with only Shrute from now on   FeelsBadMan\", \"commentId\": \"33438\", \"commentDate\": \"1489157296\"}, {\"comment\": \"opponent has a board
