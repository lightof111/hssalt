netdeck  or a Shaman  a dragon priest  a pirate warrior  or a Jade Druid  I just think Heres somebody desperate to win  too stupid to build their own deck  probably just a bit below normal

Renolock  Run only one copy of each card  Get each optimal card exactly when they need it  Ofc this isnt the case every time but its such a bullshit hit or miss deck that you cant even play around

overpowered in this shitty meta  and its so easy to beat them without a perfect start   Im close to a 100 winrate even with my Malygod Druid if they miss that shitty 1 drop  but it just barely seems

to understand how can a game designing team print such a stupid card like Jade Idol  this is the first time since vanilla that i have a huge difficulty reaching rank 15 all i see are jade druids and shamanstone  like seriously 1 freaking mana  so you can infinite draw and play with Gadgetzan Auctioneer and Fandral Staghelm and kill any chance of the whole control archtype  this month is going to be extra boring since only fast aggro can defeat these jades   damn team 5 screwed up really bad with this card\", \"commentId\": \"33074\", \"commentDate\": \"1488617276\"}]"
