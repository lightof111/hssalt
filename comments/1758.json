"[{\"comment\": \"Seriously  Arena in this game is a fucking joke   Sure  make Mage even more OP in Arena by giving him a freaking 21 dmg for 6 mana  There is no way you can play around that  Of course they seem to have like 3 of them in every deck  What the fuck went through their head when they designed this card It can deal 21 dmg for 6 mana Flame Lance on super steroids for 1 mana more  And 80 of decks you face in Arena are mages  Sure  make cards like Vicious Fledgling or Daring Reporter which can just snowball if you cant remove them immediately    Good job Blizz  this game is a joke  RNG fiesta at its finest\", \"commentId\": \"36872\", \"commentDate\": \"1494251148\"}, {\"comment\": \"DKSchrute 1504 on NA  youre welcome to spectate any time    FWIW I hit 5 every month that

extremely expensive p2w paladin deck and some other expensive or joke decks   Ill check twitch to see  and ofc last time I checked there is no one playing warlock   I have been planning on quitting until the next expansion or when they give free stuff next time so I can get a new deck  the ladder is absolute cancer and zoolock doesnt seem to do very well in it  my friend who was rank 14 cant get out of rank 19 because the decks are cancer and the game doesnt have enough to do with skill   Blizzard wants to seem so generous when in reality this game is still pay to win and in arena I get

Jades and ofcourse the most boring deck in the entire game Miracle Rogue But that was around before as well  Now atleast each class is playable  How many hunters and paladins have you seen in MSoG 2  3 Meta has been slowed and the overall experience is much more enjoyable   And arena is pretty dull atm  You have to pick Mage  Paladin or Rogue in order to do well  Other classes are really inferior
