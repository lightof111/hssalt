even realise your mindset  what I call double brawl warrior probably has some proper description  except the only knowledge I have of netdecks is the cards I see  which is an endless shitstorm of warriors playing the exact same cards  ravaging ghoul  slam  shield slam  execute  double brawl  win axe      The only variations are Cthun vs Worgen otk  very occasionally a weapon warrior with hooks and the reaper or the warrior with dragons and the 43 charge  But always each one running the exact same cards  no variation within the deck type at all  I dont for one second believe any of those players have designed their decks themselves  no originality  effective Im sure  but boring and desperate   I despise them all  I hit rank 10 last season playing only my own deck recipes  but the shitstorm of netdecks is so fucking boring  I dont mind losing to them  until the sad little fucks playing them start with bad manner emotes  as if they are clever for putting together yet another copy of token shaman or zoo  At the moment the ladder is all warrior and shaman  If its not that  its the zoo deck youve seen a million times  or a Yogg Druid yawn Insta concede sun Yogg drops  or the socalled tempo Mage running all running the exact same decklist  or that rogue with hucksters and NZoth   Nobody plays anything not netdecked  are people so desperate \", \"commentId\": \"23679\",

consec  or all priests entomb  rogue sap etc  Its just because they are the best cards to play and to win  that does have nothing to do with netdecking just with math and statistics  When you are changing your deck or rather developeimprove your deck right you will realize which cards are better and which one not or how many copies of a certain card you should run  Thats just a matter of efficent deckbuilding and not netdecking  And when you are speaking about netdecking   i bet when i am looking at decks from you and see cards other peoples are also using according to your logic that could be considered netdecking\", \"commentId\": \"23680\", \"commentDate\": \"1470469601\"}, {\"comment\": \"Are you kidding me Tens of thousands of people  by dint of logical reasoning and deck

netdecking and not because they are the best option for a certain archetype  same with rogue and sap  auctioneer  coldblood  tomb pillager and si7 agent  i just run them cause i am netdecking not because they are the best and most consistent option for a certain archetype    yeah all people are certainly netdecking and not just playing good cards     and i do not see a problem with people net decking when they are so braindead and brainwashed as you said why are you not beating  them if they do not know how to play their netdecked lists  this way you would have not to blow of steam in this kind of thread  Or is it rather that your own unique created decks just suck and you do not realize it     you were saying that tens of thousands of control warriors started to simultaneously started to play with the same deck list                                                                                                                                                                    First of all ten of thousands is not that much compared to the amount of players that are playing hearthstone  second of all warrior is the most popular class at the moment  So it is not too odd that players are running the same list unless you are so paranoid to believe in some kind of Illuminati revolution that all players are brainwashed and braindead netdeckers   You are certainly the only sane player out there that missed his math classes in school  that is not netdecking\", \"commentId\": \"23683\", \"commentDate\": \"1470471112\"}, {\"comment\": \"Waaah  All the stupid people with

out of the salt thread then and run along and climb the ladder with your CThun warrior  Raptor Rogue  or Token Shaman  or whatever amazing recipe youve read the mulligan guide for  You can pretend you worked it all out yourself  nobody will know  Ill not tell anyone  Of course its not odd the warriors are all running the exact same lists card for card    Because They just assemble the standard lists from a site like Hearthpwn  you reinforce my observations  I totally understand my homebrew decks are not as effective as the standard builds  Im just not so desperate to win that Ill join the zombie hordes playing them  But this is a salt thread so Ill complain about the mindless zombies I despise as much as I like  Some are even so mindless theyll defend their net decking in a salt thread
