only vs face decks  Well  at least that had a good outcome  I crafted Kazakus and rank up to 14  Btw If you think you are bad  I saw a jade druid play BOTH Jade Idols for summoning Jade Golem  1 of them on turn 1  Deck so idiotic that I found that at like 1615  rank where last months I had it terrible to reach\", \"commentId\": \"29201\", \"commentDate\": \"1481246286\"}, {\"comment\": \"you

braindead deck like pirate warrior requires SOME form of brainpower  Won a few games today against pirate warriors partly because of their own mistakes  Like trading their minions and last weapon charge on my big taunt and then realizing the 1 mana 32 pirate isnt a permanent buff so the taunt survives with their board gone xD\", \"commentId\": \"29209\", \"commentDate\": \"1481250708\"},

them  I spent a very long time building and testing in casual  I eventually moved to rank  then I get demolished  repeatedly by pirate warrior and other decks  and just by decks that have powerful legendaries like rag  But there are times when my deck works perfectly  its fucking infuriating\", \"commentId\": \"29210\", \"commentDate\": \"1481250838\"}, {\"comment\": \"The amount of unlucky

along time ago  disenchanted all my rare cards so Im never coming back  That made a lot of dust so I crafted the best legendaries of that game  or maybe the most rotten just as a reminder of what I think about this game at the moment  You cant play competitive without encountering someone whos not planning to kill you before turn 5  this is just stupid  Started to play during the beta and im not haing fun anymore  played for a long time but I guess I should study my exam now    It was an honor to trashtalk Face Hunters  Pirate Warriors  Jade Druids  Freeze Mages  Malygos Rogues  Zoolock
