because he played a 4 mana 77 and you havent been able to remove it but your hanging in there    except then on turn 7 he plays 2 thing from below and ancestral knowledge and THE GAME IS OVER  I dont

not any other explanation  I was happy  with my dragon paladin against a murloc paladin  Of course he as advantage in the early game and was macking some damage  but I was able to controll  Then the strangest things started to happen  first of all he was able to play the two epic murlocs before turn 4 and  before turn 5 he had already played the 4 important ones in the 50 times Ive played Paladin Murloc I have NEVER been able to do something like that  Then  turn 8  the incredible Ragnaros Lightlord  perfectly timed  of course  I was able to remove it and  for my salvation  had played Ivory Knight and took a Anything Can Happen  Even struggling against a perfect match from my opponent  I was doing fine  Then  of course  he had turn 10 first and played his Anything Can Happen  lefting me with only 2 of life  I played my Anything Can Happen and didnt had letal  so I made all trades and he had no more minions on the field while I stayed with a full board made some trades before Anything too with a total of more than 40 damage  What he played Oh  of course  Ragnaros Firelord  What happened He started to give Well Played for 1 minute and 30 seconds until the turn ended so it directly attacked my hero  even with my SEVEN MINIONS  If this wasnt hack  I dont know what was  but it was definitely not a fair game  HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD WIN  Even with odds of 18  Lets stay away for this pseudo game for a while and play something that is worth off the time\", \"commentId\": \"27256\", \"commentDate\": \"1477277554\"}, {\"comment\": \"i fucking hate people so goddamned much right now
