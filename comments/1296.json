"[{\"comment\": \"First off  this is a salt thread  Shitting on someones salt rant is sad  Second  anyone can play whatever the fook he wants  Just coz his opinion is different from yours  he now has mental issues You must be a boss  There are a lot of Shamans in the meta which means there will be a lot of mirror matches  Which means strength of deck is not enough to win you a game as both are equal in strength  A certain amount of luck which is inherent in any card game and a certain amount of skill is required\", \"commentId\": \"27184\", \"commentDate\": \"1477009396\"}, {\"comment\":

most of the people who cant tell the difference between one RNG from another  Things may look the same but if you turn on your thinking and look closely youll be able to see that subjects may look

included thus winning a late game as a tempo deck which is type of an aggro deck Because to me tactics like this are fucking retarded  Could you please explain to me where is the skillfairness in that Probably i shouldnt be looking for fairness in this game but really  Id preffer face thousands of hunters and shamans but nothing make me quit the game more than tempo mages and their imaginary spells  You plan the whole match up from the start  feel the tension  get nervous all this to loose at the end to some bullshit RNG which couldnt have been predicted at all or cards which you cant afford to play around  Really fucking NICE\", \"commentId\": \"27189\", \"commentDate\": \"1477035020\"}, {\"comment\": \"Priest is a shit class im aware but he keeps stealing all i own  I recently played five
