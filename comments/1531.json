hearthstone  Ok Im playing constructed right  Standard  Im playing a reno deck  my first time ever using one  Im not expecting to win  I Queue up end up against pally  Im like ok this shouldnt be too bad  I get a bad draw so I mulligan  I get an even worse draw  then I draw into more late game  That continued up until turn 5  He has a board full of crazy big things he grew over the past few turns  I didnt get ice block and next turn is lethal so Reno doesnt matter  I lose because I got an awful draw  So Im like ok  lets try again  Same shit didnt even get to play  and again  and again  after going 15 with it I decided ok I need to take a break  3 days of this shit over and over and over again  Im like ok I know the deck isnt bad the dude who made it got to top 100 legend with it  so why is it that every time I use it I dont even get to play the game Whatever Lets play some arena I know Im not good at arena Im bad at drafting  So Ill use Heartharena  First try yesterday  I get a nice looking warlock  couldve even been viable in constructed prepirates  first matchup Priest Easy win  second Mage loss  Third Warlock loss   Ok fine  they probably drafted better than I did  Im pretty bad this time Ill just take whatever heartharena says is good unless its obviously not   I go warrior  immediately Heartharena is making some awful picks  crazy situational stuff like the hogrider things from MSoG  About halfway through the draft I Realize heartharena has no Idea what its doing  It tried to tell me to take the cursed blade over kings defender  WHAT DOES IT WANT ME DEAD BY TURN THREE I get to the end of the draft following heartharena the rest of the way  of course with a kings defender It shows me the overview  i have two 1 mana cards  and over half the deck is turn 4  It calls this Classic Aggro Warrior BRAIN DETONATES Ok Ok Maybe its not as bad as it looks  I end up against a Priest  I have nothing to play until turn 4  Didnt get to play again    I just want to play the game   please just one fucking match let me have just one match where I get to do something   I dont even care if I win  just let me play a card for gods sake\", \"commentId\": \"32159\",

milldecks  i would disagree that everyone hates them  because i like to play against milldecks  its easy to spot one and then its a real challenge to play against them  you have to think about every
