respects you or your rank  Did you get rank 5 or legend with that shit So what  mindless bots got rank 5 to legend with those decks  We hate you and feel nothing but scorn and contempt  Your ladder rank with a cancer deck means less than nothing  It means you are pathetic  And now youre playing Shaman decks  just another broken imbalanced deck played by people who can only win by playing the latest netdecks and cancer  Rope Shaman decks  Mock them  Remind them their rank is irrelevant   end salt\", \"commentId\": \"21969\", \"commentDate\": \"1466815145\"}, {\"comment\": \"Where the fuck

it to 62 I had the craziest arena deck I made in ages minibot  double consec  blessing of kings  an uldaman keeper  rafaam  4 haunted creepers  blessing of champions     Ended in 83 because of those bitches  They can either go fullface mode while they spam emotes and win because apparently you cant either draw taunts nor heal with Tuskarr Jouster  or let RNGesus do all the bullshit with Faceless Summoner summonned a Silverback Patriarch so I couldnt lethal  then only two cards on the hand were Stormwind Champion and Polymorph Boar for exact fucking lethal  I know I am not suppoused to be

\"commentDate\": \"1466869170\"}, {\"comment\": \"This is my first salty post  so let me know if Im doing this right  Ice block and Reno Jackson are the most unfun cards in hearthstone ok maybe not the MOST but certainly at the top of my list at the moment  I mean  they both are cards that literally allow you to not care about anything that goes on with your health or board besides maybe the occasional clear and a healbot or something  I mean iceblock literally keeps you from dying for a turn  Alot of people are like hey  it only postpones your death for like a turn  its balanced  And yes  I would agree with you if that extra turn didnt give you a chance to i dunno  kill your opponent or heal yourself fully  Which brings me to Reno  a card credited with making control decks more viable after TGT  Alot of control players are pretty proud of the fact that they play control  which makes sense because alot of the time playing control is more fun and requires more strategy  Well  playing reno forfeits your elite status  because it literally makes control decks as dumb to play as aggro  Automatic reset buttons like reno mean that you honestly dont have to care about your health at all which literally takes half the skill out of the control archetype  Now you can just deal with your opponents minions occasionally and then reset your health  easy win  Which honestly doesnt sound very fun   Anyway that was my rant  And FYI  Im not a salty aggro player  Im a salty control player who plays hearthstone to have fun and not just to win lots of games sorry sorry I think my rant seeped in

the top of the pile for years   Shaman has been at least middle of the road along with Druid   Priest has basically been dead and gets worse while the other classes get improvements each time   Blizz must hate Priests\", \"commentId\": \"21979\", \"commentDate\": \"1466872894\"}, {\"comment\": \"Yeah Priest has just gotten worse with each new release of cards    but look what Blizzard did for shaman  give them enough broken cards and their decks become viable  So I wouldnt be surprised if next release brings some broken priest cards that put them up with the rest  But unfortunately Priest at the moment is basically only limited to control versions  A midrange priest would be sick\", \"commentId\": \"21980\", \"commentDate\": \"1466873609\"}, {\"comment\": \"Untrue  unless playing Dragon Priest  any agro or midrange deck can lock you down for 4 turns pretty easily   Priest simply doesnt have the defenses and most players just want to go face for the easy win   Blizzard needs to create some mechanics to allow Priest to defend itself   Think that Paladin the Noble Sacrifice  Mage has Ice Block and Ice Barrier and Vaporize  Warriors and Druids have Armor overhaul Hunters have Misdirection  Explosive Trap  Freezing Trap   These are all at level 2 while Priest has no board presence and no way to protect themselves from being overwhelmed by turn 4   First possible 2 card
