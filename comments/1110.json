turn 1Mana Wyrm  turn 2 Sorcerer into ArcaneMirror Image  and always have Flamewaker to follow it up  and if they dont have any of that  theyre just freezing my board for 6 turns  they drop Emperor  I break their ice block  and then I die  When all hope is lost for them  they drop Yogg Sauron  who gives them 6 secrets  clears my board  and buffs their minions  completely winning the game  Honest facing any other class for me is a better experience  even if I beat mages half the time  there are no fun interactions with mage  there is no proper minion trading from them  there are very little mind games  I really hope there is never a day where Mage is top of the meta again  because even in their current state  theyre still a frustrating and antifun class\", \"commentId\": \"23173\",

deck to play against  because you dont really play against freeze mage  you just end your turn without doing jack shit  The worst are players defending the deck and talking about how much skill the deck needs  Go fuck yourselfs  all you need is rng draws and nothing  NOTHING more\", \"commentId\": \"23174\", \"commentDate\": \"1469549734\"}, {\"comment\": \"I know what you mean  Thats why I play different Mages myself  For instance a Reno Mage Echo of the Dragon I call it  29 different cards  except Duplicate  that has 2  more Minions then Spell Cards  I can imagine Duplicate or Echo of Medivh can also be annoying for a player  especially in combination with reno or DragonLord  But at least the games will take longer then 3 minutes  against a Freeze or Tempo Mage  and are more fun

about this game anymore  and each time i play it i feel so fucking bad  I play nzoth pally and face 75 of the time cthun warrior  i play carefully to not draw more than him and stall removing his stuff the best i can  but that doesnt really matter at all i i just cant play nzoth against him because of the card you all know and love as much as i do  so the warrior just plays triple cthun and wins 100 of the time  i really enjoy myself with that matchup  When i play other kinds of control i loose horribly to aggro and warrior anyway  when i try cool decks with cool viable legendaries i just got rekt by the same decks over and over  My wish for the game is Fix warrior and its very core  I find control warrior 100 unbeatable by any control deck if played good  with nzoth it seemed that this would be fixed but i was thinking about wild  they just have to save a brawl and its game over  They have the ability to win a fatigue match just cause the nature of the class  They have enough removal to kill every single minion vs a control deck and then they win by pressing heropower  You can beat control warrior with combo decks such as rogue no doubt about that  and aggro beats the shit out of combo  and control tries to stall vs aggro and then outpaces them  of course    but there is the core problem i want to highlight  I find this counter system terribly dull and in my opinion is killing the game  the game should be a whole lot better if the archetypes and classes could fight eachother and have a decent chance to win vs every deck out there  Tell me if you feel the same about the whole thing or not guys  how do you see it\", \"commentId\": \"23191\", \"commentDate\": \"1469557854\"}, {\"comment\": \"But still  even if I got 2 legendaries in ten packs that I
