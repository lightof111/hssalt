depending on draw  Aggro hunter is fucking boring to face and quickly lethal  Taunt warrior is fucking impossible if you dont run Aggro or ridiculous burst finish of some sort  Jade Druid is unbeatable if you dont kill it by turn 10  Aggro murloc is the same as Quest rogue  but more consistent  Dirty rat played by you or at you can win or lose a game  but there is no skill in drawing it to your hand and no skill in determining what it pulls  Pirate warrior is still the deck of choice of pedofiles and just as reprehensible to play  Freeze Mage variants are boring to play against and if they assemble their pieces not much that can be done  they often lose but what a boring waste of time  The throw randomly generated spells at your face Mage either gets lucky with spells in which case you lose or doesnt in which case its pathetic  Miracle Rogue with plants has too much removal if it gets its auctioneer cycling  but youll die of boredom watching those turns before the deck kills you  Every second CUNT at every rank think the wow emote makes them seem clever or ironic and 90 of players say well played before lethal  meaning they played well with their dicks fucking social retards  Hearthstone started out out good but has turned into a steaming pile of shit due to the decisions of the worst employee of the gaming industry ever in any capacity  fire Ben Brode and

little pieces of shit who play pirate warrior not even using any new ungoro cards just to get their cheap free wins  The minute I see the quest card played by a rogue or the standard 1dmg weapon
