Warrior  and Dragon Priest are going to realise they are going to lose a lot with the next expansion if they are not playing the new cancer decks that will inevitably spring up BECAUSE YOU SUCK AT YOUR JOB  People are going to work out the con of broken cancer decks running on ladder and how much it costs to keep buying packs to get them  The games going to collapse Bendover CHODE and its on you  If you had balanced things  not got greedy releasing OP decks to pump sales of packs  and had the intelligence to make real playing improvements  like dealing with rope abuse  emote abuse  bugs in your code  bots and exploits  and if you hadnt LIED about nonrandom matchmaking     you might have kept this game going  Itll be tumbleweeds and crickets by the end of the year  Your fault CHODE  Its on you  I just cant face another game of getting overwhelmed by jades  bored to death by Reno  getting my face smashed by pirates  or watching dragons snowball   Brode absolutely will not get year of the mamoth right  hes too stupid and too greedy  NEVER GIVE BLIZZARD MONEY FOR THIS SHIT GAME  Boy do I regret ever getting my credit card out to be conned into building a card base What a load of

new expansion  I really have to stop reading hype threads  Inevitably someone says but the quests are all legendary and essential  Blizzard hate f2p players  and my brain dies a little  The reasons the new quests exist is to practically create new archetypes  while the rest of the sets are geared towards the rest of the class vibe  Yes  there is a lot of obvious synergy  and yes  some of the quests are going to be autoincludes  but is everyone really thinking the Warrior quest is a MUST HAVE unless you really love old school control warrior Are elemental priests or shaman players going to give a flying rats testicle about their quests Probably not  I love Jade and CThun Rogue decks  so their new legendaries are both pretty useless to me  Im still excited for multiple decks  across multiple archetypes  and yet I can acknowledge not every legendary card is essential  I kinda pity anyone whos looked at this card reveal and thought wow  I literally need to play EVERY SINGLE DECK
