hate losing to fucking SEA server plebtards who have bad decks and make statistically incorrect plays but they manage to get wins off me because they get lucky as shit  I honestly hope all of them get

just frankly disgusting that these subhumans can get so fucking lucky against me and win when they would never be able to hold consistent top legend on any server  Interrupting my speedclimbs is just

luck  but thats RNG  it should be minimized imo  but theyre introducing cards like that  Generally  I dont mind a card like Piloted Shredder  as they give you one random event minion  effect etc  but these cards that give you multiple random outcomes are not what the game should be about   skill in HS exists in deckbuilding  decision making etc   but can be beat by sheer luck anytime  Ive done it

some big bodies  you are happy  And since this is exactly what Golden Monkey gives 90 of the time  its very healthy RNG  I just was extremely unlucky getting very shitty cheap minions  but only
