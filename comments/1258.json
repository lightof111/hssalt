"[{\"comment\": \"236 spells if I counted correctly lets just round it at 235 for the sake of argument       He got 1 in 235    Now what kind of RNG is that  Note I dont mind losing I mind THE WAY I lost    since that was the only card he couldve gotten that was able to kill me instantly Call Of The Wild  Sure wouldve been hard to deal with but you can see my hand  I think I had another Consecration or Equality in my deck and ANOTHER ANYFIN to round it up to Anyfin only I wouldve been able to deal with it since I already dealt with Yogg     BUT out of all possible cards from all 9 classes he gets THE ONE that kills me thanks to Me   basically  Anyfin    Now tell me what kind of RNG is that I dont mind RNG that has small range of possible outcomes such as Sylvanas its a fair RNG basically but RNG such as Yogg Saron with 235 Spells and Spellslinger with the same number or Tuscar Totemic with possible 3 mana 43 Tuscar and Searing totem or 66 Tuscar and Golem thats just bad RNG     Criticize me as much as you want but you know that Im right to certain extent\", \"commentId\": \"26392\", \"commentDate\": \"1474966532\"}, {\"comment\": \"Youre right about everything but Spellslinger  Yes he was incredibly lucky but its the only RNG in your examples thats fair for both players  since you too get a random spell that potentially couldve turned the game upside down\",

absurdly high winrate with  And no  currently if you want a high winrate there arent a zillion choices  Malygos Yogg druid  control warrior  hybrid hunter  aggromidrange shaman and tempo mage  Most of those are easy and cancer  By the way  I forgot to add that I havent even played aggro shaman this season and only a couple of games with hybrid hunter on rank 5 because I met druid after druid  Its just that I feel like I have to play cancer to actually do very well in the higher ranks with all the druids atm\", \"commentId\": \"26395\", \"commentDate\": \"1474981028\"}, {\"comment\": \"Well  as

deck  I want to know how it goes against the top decks  Getting burned out by some janky 8 card combo is no indication as to how a deck will actually go against proper decks  When your mill hunter deck loses enough matches to proper decks  youll eventually end up getting paired with someone playing pirate priest or beast mage and you can have a fun game  So you are  playing in casual to see how youll perform against top decks In CASUAL against TOP decks    Rest my case\", \"commentId\": \"26406\", \"commentDate\": \"1475000044\"}, {\"comment\": \"OK  confess  Who the fuck told face shamans
