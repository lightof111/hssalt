"[{\"comment\": \"Honest question  what is the fun in playing Pirate Warrior  You dont win the game because of any decisions you made you win only because you played the cards   The cards do all the

Warrior  He broke my Reno Shadow Priest by turn 4  I asked him outright exactly the question you posed and his response I had the Play 30 Warrior Class Cards Quest and this was the easiest and quickest way to do it  I hate the deck and Id rather be playing Control  But this is sooooo easy   Thats your answer Im afraid SchruteBucks  Its easy to play and he didnt have to think about it  I used to think Pirate Warrior was Ok  not that bad and if you get the board early you beat him fairly easily  Now Im not so sure  I think something is wrong really  When you can make a deck that requires zero thought process and still wins 6570 of the time  then something is rotten in Denmark\", \"commentId\": \"29310\", \"commentDate\": \"1481390134\"}, {\"comment\": \"Flame imp is an insane
