"[{\"comment\": \"That disconnect bug has been around for a long time  and is a pile of shit  If you wait until the game has fully ended and you arent in queue it doesnt happen  but if you do it as the game is recording winlose and quest progression it always wants to DC you   Not to be a dick  but if youre literally super salty after every game maybe just dont play  Im not trying to troll you or whatever  But if you are going to post in this thread after every game whats the point You dont seem to be enjoying the game  The complaining doesnt seem to be helping at all  as you continuously have to do it  Youre mad at people for literally anything they do that wins them the game  even if its playing something that isnt netdeck cancer bullshit  If literally everything about the game is frustrating maybe you should just give up the ghost and put it to rest\", \"commentId\": \"32174\", \"commentDate\": \"1486846542\"}, {\"comment\": \"its really rewarding when i hope i top deck a

only post after bullshit losses which every loss    i havent ever lost a game due to my own misplays  theyre entirely due to my opponent getting insane topdecks or me only drawing pretty good  and not godtier  which is what i need in order to beat my opponents insane draws    yes   i do get fucking pissed off when i dont get a fair hearthstone experience and my opponents are playing top tier constructed decks in casual  AND get all of the luck    all i want is a fair experience and a place to play against non preconstructed ladder decks   fwiw i havent played a netdeck in casual in a

\"Dude  its random  Its a major factor in card based games  The experience is set for or against anyone  And while you might find losing disappointing  its pretty fair to say  no one wins them all  Yes  you might have good and bad days or even simply small parts of days  That doesnt mean the game or even the player base is actually against you  If you only lose when you draw badly  guess what  thats how card games work  If you cant handle losing at all  maybe play a game based solely  or at least more highly  on skill and less on luck  HS has become more and more tempo and therefore draw dependant  Skill matters less and less and draw matters more and more  You cant control that  none of us really can  So being salty at literally every loss is just ignorant\", \"commentId\":
