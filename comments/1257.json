play tempo rogue and get smahsed by resurecct priest who gets perfect draws  2 noninjured blademasters at turn 4  It doesnt really matter that i lost 4 stars but just the fact that im never lucky

insist on using twitch emotes in the forum  They dont make any sense without the icons and they make you sound like a fucking idiot who cant use normal language  2  The use of the word trade Trading means exchanging  Unless my yeti is damaged  it doesnt trade with your 44  it kills it  I can trade 4 imps with your fierce monkey  but if I run 1 imp into it it isnt trading at all  it is suiciding  3  People who get angry about other people playing top tier decks in casual  If Im testing a deck  I want to know how it goes against the top decks  Getting burned out by some janky 8 card combo is no indication as to how a deck will actually go against proper decks  When your mill hunter deck loses enough matches to proper decks  youll eventually end up getting paired with someone playing pirate priest or beast mage and you can have a fun game  4  People making new threads to rant  USE THE FUCKING SALT THREAD 5  People who think theyre clever because they play control decks  In the history of hearthstone theres been about 3 decks which are genuinely difficult to play and none of them were heavy control  Decks which draw multiple cards per round can  be hard to pilot due to the speed you have to make decisions  but clicking armour up every turn and clearing the board isnt that fucking difficult You havent invented the wheel here  so stop acting so superior  6  Incessant complaining about the state of the game  If you arent enjoying it  stop playing Ive seen some of the monstrosities in the fan creations thread  and I can tell you now  team 5 is doing a much better job than you dickheads who think you know better than they do  Now that thats off my chest  Im going to have a nice cup of tea  Enjoy your day\", \"commentId\": \"26386\", \"commentDate\": \"1474960974\"},

at the recent interview with mike donais like wtf does it means its on your radar      in 7 months all the powerhouse shaman cards will rotate out so maybe fucking do something before then and trust me tuskarr totemic isnt the only powerful card but its certainly the most unfair  and shaman will be strong even with the tuskarr nerfed just not 80 of the meta i believe      their stats show that shaman is 20 like from where they get their stats im tired of the same shit every some months  they create 1 OP broken piece of shit deck we have to deal with it for 6 months then they say oh we
