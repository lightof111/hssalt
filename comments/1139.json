\"People complain about aggro Shaman  and thats fine because it is really strong  but Shaman was considered one of the worst classes for most of the games life so I think it does deserve the spot its in right now  Compare that to Warrior and Warlock who always had a spot at or near the top in constructed play  It seems like the devs have a hardon for those two classes in particular judging by the quality of cards they make for them every single expansion  but no one seems to whine as hard about those as they do about Shaman which has literally only been considered good for a few months  Why is thatEdit Also  Blizzard can go screw themselves for making a card like Purify  Easily the worst card ever printed for the class that needs help the most\", \"commentId\": \"23797\", \"commentDate\":
