rotate out  Thing is  this game has always had an OP FotM  sometimes 2 or 3 at the same time  It will never get balanced or change  this is the way developers and management want it to be  a retard aggro fuck fest and the illusion of hope with continuous releases of broken adventures and expansions     Im still waiting for Pokemon Go to release in asia and literally just sit here all day and read about it and tap refresh on Niantics twitter on the off chance of an announcement from these unprofessional assholes without a community manager  To be completely honest its actually more fun than playing this freakshow that is Hearthstone  I dont care if PoGo is broken as fuck too and almost unplayable from what I hear  I could play tetris and still have more fun than I have in Hearthstone  Only reason I dont hang out somewhere else is because I havent found a great hangout for PoGo yet hit me up if you know of one and I kinda like it here in the salt thread  also hanging out in the salty asian release status thread on reddit hehe  Once PoGo hits Thailand  you wont see me here as much if at all  With my luck and our fucking traffic Ill probably be hit by a bus or motorbike when I go pokemon hunting though  but thats salt for another day and hey   that would probably be more fun and interactive than Aggrostone anyway\", \"commentId\": \"22957\",

completely frustrating when my opponent is making misplay after misplay and still wins     BLAH  Last experience with this was me playing Yogg druid I am top decking and I am sitting at 10 HP   I am a few short of lethal on board with a mage secret up Happens to be spell bender   My opponent has a 99 and a 32 on board   If my opponent was paying attention clearly wasnt he could have guessed that it was either Ice Block  Barrier or Spellbender   Two of the three options require trading by him   His play is of course first attack face with the 32 and then with the 99     grrr\", \"commentId\":
