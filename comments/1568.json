"[{\"comment\": \"Hearthstone is not enjoyable anymore  We have a garbage community and the game is not enjoyable unless you play solo adventures  After being forced out of standard i am now only finding garbagely unfun decks to play against in wild too   There is no enjoyment in the game  Screw all the cards they are adding with the same aggro core still being in the game  Its a temp fix and nothing will change with the fun in the game other than 34weeks after expansion launch  I pay for my cards with real cash and 34 weeks is not worth it  I wont buy cards untill the last moment because i want to see some hope for the game in the cards released otherwise i will forfeit all the cash i put in the game and call it quits  because lets face it  I am playing because i put this much cash in the game and not because its fun  I am pretty sure plenty of you are in the same boat  Nothing will change untill things change  We need more game modes with different rules then current standard and wild  Hearthstone is plebstone because they want the mainstream idiots playing it  so chances are we wont see them untill the last stand of people  Sorry game  i cant face you anymore  Screw blizzard and screw myself for believing in it  Salty about my cash\", \"commentId\": \"32924\", \"commentDate\": \"1488295768\"}, {\"comment\": \"Ill post the salt for my pally opponent that I attempted to play in casual the other day   Im sorry that you saw warrior and instantly conceded without even playing   Im sorry that pirate warriors have crapped up your life so much that as soon as you see a warrior in casual you concede   However  I was playing control warrior bro   I had just come off an incredible comeback win against an aggro shaman the game before thank you top deck revenge   Because of your concede I got my 2 win warrior quest done  but winning by concede because you thought I was a pirate warrior isnt good for either of us\", \"commentId\": \"32925\", \"commentDate\":

salty at myself and the game  Didnt have time to play much this month  and whenever i played it was for the lulz  so i was at 20  But its the end of the month and there are gold cards to be earned  so i made aggro shaman and pirate warrior and made my way to rank 9 in couple of hours i have around 6k wins  but im far from good player and often play while doing something else  What a sad state of
