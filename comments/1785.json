can someone explain to me how those cancerous Quest Rogues work I mean how can they play out the Quest at turn 1  Play one card  then complete the Quest with a completely different card The card text says Play four minions with the same name Then he plays like Novice Engineer and completes the quest with a fucking firefly and their tokens Thank god Gwent Open Beta starts soon  Edit Ah okay  I was just worried because under the quest it shows the name of the minion first played and that it can be only completed with this one  That would actually make Quest rogue more balanced imo\",
