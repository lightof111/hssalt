player  I dont emote offensively  just the cordial Greetings at the start  Well Played at the end regardless if I win or lose  Or if my opponent pulled a nice play that I liked  like a good comeback  or an interesting way to gather up the dmg needed to clear my board  theyll get a Well Played as well  In noncompetitive Magic the Gathering I even remind my opponents of their triggers even though Im not required to cause I dont wanna win due to my opponents missplays   But Pirate Warrior I will abuse the shit out of them  You want fast  efficient wins while Im chilling  playing fun stupid decks that Im either trying out or doing silly Play X class cards quests You can die in hell  Rope every turn  Spam wow emote after every single play they make  regardless if its good or bad  BM them even MORE when I manage to stabilize  Make them concede instead of beating them when Im about to win  Anything to make their day a living hell and waste their time  For what its worth  the time spent losingwinning against me is time spent NOT ruining the game for everybody else out there  This happens in lower ranks  because all the kiddos really enjoy spamming emotes while they Face you down to 18 health by turn 3  In higher ranks  they shut the hell up  cause they know theyre playing an excessively finetuned aggro deck which is extremely consistent and needs a perfect hand on the opposing side to be answered   At about ranks 32  I was on my own custom list of Cthun Druid running experimental stuff like Trueheart  I really love the Dire Shapeshift hero power  2 dmg  2 armour per turn adds up quickly and Im paired up against Pirate Warrior  Due to Wild Growth  an Innervated Thaurissan on T3 and Trueheart right after  I stabilize the game quite quickly  using my buffed up Hero Power to clear his patheticly small minions while throwing out Dark Arakkoas  Ancients of War and Druids of the Claw in bear form  The guy then proceeded to add me  I accept the friend request  Me GG man  what can I do for you Ive realized that  when added  if YOU talk first instead of THEM  they think twice before flaming Him Trueheart in Druid Really Me Yeah  I took out 1 Twilight Elder for her  mostly to help me out in the control matchup  Seems she works fine against aggro too  Him She singlehandedly won you the game  Me Well it was the fact I dropped her on T4 due to druid shenanigans  but yeah  she did a good job  We then proceeded to have a lengthy discussion about archetypes  where the game was heading  he turned out to be a multiLegend player like myself and all in all it was a nice chat  Moral of the story Pirate Warriors in higher ranks arent THAT bad  cause they understand theyre playing a deck which is very annoying to play against and they dont add insult to injury most of the time  But the lower ranked ones They can burn in hell for being complete douchebags with no respect for their fellow opponent\", \"commentId\": \"29628\", \"commentDate\": \"1481920134\"},
