Either you play the really stupid undertaker allin face deck  or the slow get 6 cards into my hand and dump at face control deck Theres almost never been just    a control deck  Why Because its strictly worse than the control deck you can make that has a massive unstoppable burst combo Its so unfun Dirty Rat is a great step into the direction of nerfing this kind of bullshit  but its  as usual  random  so very inconsistent  Just make a discard already  I want to play actual control decks where the game doesnt end with both players having 8 card hands and 25 life\", \"commentId\":
