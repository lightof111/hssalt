aggro  but control mirrors are maybe besides otk mirrors the hardest matchups there are  Ive played control  Ive played aggro  Ive played it all  You can ask any pro  if control is harder than aggro

win every  single  RNG  event I tell the card they need to have or topdeck exactly to turn around or win the game  they always have it  12 cards in hand out of 2025  they ALWAYS have it  Or if they happen to be still losing  bam  Yogg  clears my board  summons spiders  heal him  and call of the wild my face after casting tentacles and blessing of kings on huffer  Last time I played yogg it instantly killed itself and pyroblasted my own face twice  buffing his board up  Not like it matters  since I died to the pyros Last game  the guy topdecks freezing trap on empty hand  preventing my giant from hitting for lethal  then proceeds to topdeck second call of the skill and gives him a 2 turn lethal  Astounding  Im legit afraid of my luck  karma  or whatever you call it at this point  it shouldnt be statistically possible to lose this many chances in my favour  or 5050s  I just print screened out the event happening as Im writing this  guess where the Ragnaros hit landed  Exactly  And I lost the game after because Yogg fucked me  Of course this isnt a big deal in itself  but this happening every game  every single time  I just dont know what to do  This same unluck is common IRL as well  If this whole thing is a joke  its a really  really bad one  Meanwhile  next game which just ended another rag hit my face for lethal with me having 2 minions on board and lethal for next turn
