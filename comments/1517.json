deck for the night but the very first game I get absolutely shit on by the most unfun  dumbest RNG imaginable  I do everything well  play perfectly and get incredibly punished by the biggest load of

row  so  im currently playing an anti aggro nzoth hunter in wild  you might think  wtf  but this has some serious reasons  Hunter has the cheapest boardclears in the game  explosive trap and powershot  as well as dreadscale  in combination with hunters mark  sludge belchers  antique healbots  a Mistress of mixtures and doomsayer  no pirate warrior or aggro shaman stands a Chance  but  coming to game number one  all those do only two damage  so  a coined alexstrasas Champion into another alexstrastas Champion is not that easy to deal with  still  i somehow managed to fight back into the game  drain all his resources  clear the board multiple times  and heal me to 12 and bring him to topdeckmode with also 10 health  deathwing in Hand  he has some board and i think to myself  well thats a win  he has no weapon  execute wont help him  and played both fierce monkeys  ez gg  power incarnate so on and so forth  with 12 Cards left in deck  no board  no Hand  that cunt topdecks his deathwing  not even all variations run this shit  well  still not over  i have Options  deadly shot or nzoth both either win me the game or at least give me a Chance  8 Cards left  1 in 4  drawing fucking loot hoarder  so  salty as fuck i Queue again  against a warlock  i think to myself  hey easy win  warlock hero power  hunter hero power  burst  easy win   only way i lose this is either some sylvanas shenanigans stealing a highmane  10 mana polymorph from kazakus or dirty rat pulling my nzoth   so the game goes ok  he using his hardremoval freely  practically wasting it  an early kazakus  everything going as planned  i was unlucky drawing my nzoth pretty early  but thinking to be smart i always kept two other minions in Hand and chipping hero power everytime i could  to stop dirty rat  fucking useless  dirty rat on naked board  pulling nzoth  one in three  still not lost i think  still got deathwing  he continues playing jaraxxus  both nearing fatigue  Me playing deathwing as i knew he had no hard removal left  taunt taunt doomsayer  fuck  he  at 4 life  topdecks abyssal enforcer for exact lethal  next game aggro shaman  another favorable match up  same Story as the Dragon warrior  Clearing  healing  draining resoucres  now the good part  i have a deathwing  two hunters marks and deadly shot in Hand  hes got a 477  easy deadly shot  that cunt kills my Shredder with a lightning bolt  and out popps     lorewalker cho  WHAAAAAAATTHEEEEEFUUUUUUCK i cant give him deadly shot or hunters mark  otherwise my win condition in deathwing is useless  so i hope he either Plays a spell or clears cho  i can still stall having both healbots and 30 life  so i stall  no Clearing of cho in sight  hes building up a board  and finally dumb enough to clear cho  nows my Chance  i clear everything with a combination of that murloc boardclear  hunters marks and dreadscale  he poops down his entire Hand another 477 and some other big stuff  not able to clear and low on health as fuck  i Play deathwing  14 life  so hes dead next turn  he topdecks Spirit claws hitting face bringing me to 9  and rolling a taunt totem  fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck  ok  one turn extra  hoping for sludge belcher  i topdeck     highmane  good enough  Clearing the taunt with the destroyer of worlds  hes left with no board  no Hand  12 life  and Spirit claws  his turn  rolling totem  rolling spellpower  with 14 Cards left in deck  and one copy already gone  that fucking son of cunt topecks    Lava burst  6 from Lava burst  3 from sprit claws  exact  fucking  lethal  if i could  i would have punched that guy so hard in the face that he would never have the guts to Play a Standard deck in wild ever again  stuff those claws up your butt shaman scum  not worthy of living  goddamit\", \"commentId\":

is play a jade  pass  That strategy beats this deck easily  You simply cant afford to take the damage turn after turn  but you also dont have enough removal to 1 for 1 all their Jades Once they get to 55 and 66 jades  youre done  Now they just play 1 card and totem and you have to deal with the jade without using AoE  which makes all your revenges worthless  The deck also doesnt rush you down  which again never triggers revenge  You just get grinded out of the game by Jades  The only way to win is if the Jade player is bad  Thats it  Even then you need lucky brawls and lucky rats  Jade druid is also an auto concede and priest is just a bad matchup Thats like 70 of what I faced   so  yeah    I did eventually face some patches  which I destroyed  This just makes this deck really unfun to play  More rock paper scissors  You either get a patches deck that you crush  or you get a reno  jade deck that stomps you  Woopee Id rather play Dragon Priest that can actually win against anything decently often\", \"commentId\": \"31863\", \"commentDate\": \"1486119344\"}, {\"comment\": \"Its still different from the pure legend meta  The idea of his control warrior is that considering the high chance of patches decks you meet in legend  bad matchups are acceptable losses  Just because the ladder resetted  doesnt mean the ladder is now equal to legend meta And consider that Fib does pretty much nothing but try to make control warrior work  every single season    But I digress  Im with you on this one  its much more enjoyable to just go dragon priest than suffer with
