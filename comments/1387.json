second  4 cards in hand  all 4 were bad  so they all get tossed  I draw Raven Idol  Living Roots  Wrath  and Jade Idol  With this truly amazing hand  I was super stoked  I had just played this guy and he beat me bad  revenge would be swift  He opens with standard pirates  Southsea Deckhand  which calls Patches the Pirate  I tempo the absolute hell out of the board after drawing innervate  casting a total of 5 spells on turn 1 disgusting  right It gets better  As I have the dominant board  he simply Axes my face  pathetic  Over the next two turns I discover Innervate and top deck an Arcane Giant  This amounts to a turn three 88 in stats  Truly Amazing  I think you know where this is going  As he upgrades his axe and beats me up a little  I notice that my health is already at 18  After slamming charger into charger which I clear my opponent plays Arcanite Reaper  and I feel a sinking feeling in my stomach  as I go down to 8 life  he sits comfortably at nine  savoring the Leeroy Jenkins burning a hole in my soul  As he knocks me to the pit  I feel part of myself die and regret every decision Ive made in life up to this point   All this to say    blizz plz\", \"commentId\": \"29073\",

basically not actually playing the deck you want and instead teching in like 56 cards specifically to beat just this one dumb deck Thats not a healthy game state On top of that  grinding up ladder is really long and tedious so people favor fast decks  and if that deck is basically as good as every other  or slightly worse  then people play only the fast deck and everyone else is just playing a deck for fun while they deal with asshats trying to farm wins while not even enjoying themselves  The meta hasnt settled yet though and I havent seen THAT much face warrior  People do see to still be playing varied decks so its a welcome change from before where it was just the same like 3 decks all the time But Id love to have face warrior settle as a tier 3 deck with basically a 5055 win rate if you play it optimally at lower ranks  and a sub50 at legend\", \"commentId\": \"29077\", \"commentDate\": \"1481079784\"}, {\"comment\": \"Played a card every turn   I only had four turns   The latest

start They kind of tried to make it more about handbuffing  which again no one has played The goon cards would have been good only in warlock I think  but in other classes the only viable aggro archetype is FACEISTHEPLACE The idea of the goon cards is to sacrifice early tempo to gain some kind of midgame board  but that seems to not work very well from what Ive seen  Even in arena its like    pretty crap  Giving up board control is so disastrous in this game that you really need a spectacularly stupid bonus for doing so\", \"commentId\": \"29092\", \"commentDate\": \"1481093587\"}]"
