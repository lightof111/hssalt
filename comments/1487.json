in a while I thought itd be fun to play Freeze Mage  and got matched up with this Golden Shaman     Turn 8 I play DoomsayerFrost Nova mostly to tank face damage he had Spirit Claws up and I had no way

Alex and she gets Hexed also he Jade Lightnings my face    The guy didnt topdeck either of those cards so he couldve easily dealt with the Doomsayer instead he risked the most threating minion he had for no reason at all     Not to mention he had previously wasted Bloodlust apparently to deal with Ice Barrier and had given me 3 cards out of Acolyte of Pain in a failed attempt of making me
