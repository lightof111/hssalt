topdecks and lucks out Brawl and a thief rogue that started roping the shit out of me at the second she knew was winning  And people wonder why creativity is dead in casual  You either are a top

someone can tell me how Quest Rogue is supposed to be T1  If it werent for rank Floors  I would literally have dropped down to rank 5312 from rank 5 in the last few hours  There is nothing this deck

the time to complete the quest or do anything  Oh  you really managed to completed the quest on turn 5  once in a time  Doesnt matter  Rexxar shoots everything in your face until you explode  just

and uninteracive decks out there  THats not a coincidence  Just because at the lower ranked levels there are people trying to jump on the Quest Rogue bandwagon without understanding how to play it  doesnt make the deck any worse  Just the players  When you manage to climb the ranks a little  yuo will start to meet versions of this deck that actually works the way people are complaining about

right now  Quest Rogue Ill start calling it QR is literally Tier 5  because of the cited Ultra Super duper aggro decks I meet like 90  By the way  its suuuuch a wrong statement that only Pirate Warrior would consistently beat QR  Look at the VS data  The Problem is the extremly polarized matchup spread  And when you play in a meta where 90 of the time you hit into a badextremly bad matchup e g  Secret Mage  which is getting more and more popular  then QR does not do anything  In a vaccum  yes  it may be strong  but it is so meta depending  Much more like e g  huntards  To cut a long story

that this should not devolve into a singular discussion about QR  Its still a cancer deck  any way yuo look at it  and theres certainly no harm here about being salty one way or the other about it This particular sentence  however  I do disagree with since you directly contradict it when you said You can all stop the whining about Quest Rogue  Its Tier 5  Heres my intense guide at how to beat Quest Rogue SmOrc You made very clear that the most consistent way to beat QR is by Smorcing  And whats the biggest most cancerous Smorc deck out there right now Pirate Warrior  Hence  PW is the only truly consistent deck against QR  Possibly FaceHuntard can sometimes do it  but without the GodDraw  that deck is much too slow  It rarely kills by turn 5  which is the necessity for the win\",
