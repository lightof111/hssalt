of the card is Oh look  a salty aggro player  I find it really annoying that you immediately dismiss people like this without even considering their point of view  regardless of how loud and salty they are  And honestly  fine  Go ahead and play Reno  Its not all that common of an archetype anyway  However  it doesnt take too much critical thinking to understand that a card that heals your hero fully  undoing all your opponents progress for the entire game is kind of OP  so stop being obnoxious about it  Also  while youre at it  stop being so smug about being a control player  Playing Reno Jackson literally takes half the skill out of control  seeing as you dont really have to care about your health at all  only really focusing on removal   Also FYI  I am in fact a shaman player  I play control shaman in wild and absolutely hate this card\", \"commentId\": \"22473\", \"commentDate\": \"1467871047\"}, {\"comment\": \"yay New day  new hopes and dreams Lets play some Hearthstone Surely

cap If i dont mind saying so myself  it increases it  You sacrificed consistency by making the entire deck oneofs  While youre doing that  the whole freaking meta is filled with face decks  You dont need to care about health Dude  every single time if I lose out to a freaking aggro decks due to the ridiculous curves they have and the new balanced cards blizzard released  it doesnt matter if I heal myself to full  I have no board and they just fking go face  The worst part is  when you dont draw Reno  So dont freaking bash on a card when youre currently playing the most OP class atm  See

The deck is by no means neutered by having less twoofs  and the better Reno decks tend to have twoofs of the stronger cards anyway  As for health  I concede that aggro decks are stronger this in this meta  but the correct response isnt to make an insane full reset card  but better anti aggro cards like what cult apothecary and cyclopian horror shouldve been and cheaper board clears  As for your argument that shaman is the most op class  youre absolutely right  However  that is almost exclusively aggro and super aggressive midrange decks  If you actually looked at any control shaman lists  youll find the exact opposite\", \"commentId\": \"22477\", \"commentDate\": \"1467872882\"}, {\"comment\": \"I agree  This is just personal opinion but having a Reno gives your deck more space to put

the point of fully healing your hero when your opponent just hits face again and gets you down to low health anyway The point is even if you heal  you still lose tempo because the opponent will remove the Reno and put more minions down and you are effectively back at square one  In addition  your only have a 30 or 33 chance of drawing Reno by turn 6 so its far from consistent  Having only one of a strong core card such as Hellfire or Brawl does have its setbacks so you need to know what other individual cards to put in  There is skill involved in deciding the other 29 unique individual tech cards in a Reno deck   For example  cutting out a BGH for a Doomsayer in an aggro meta or cutting a Mind Control Tech for a Rag in a control meta  The point of Reno is to counter aggro decks which are swarming the current meta  Its just tough luck if you happen to face a Reno deck who has Reno by turn 6 as an aggro player\", \"commentId\": \"22480\", \"commentDate\": \"1467880671\"}, {\"comment\":

the standard meta is so stale and aggro heavy  However  I think the misconception you have here is that the only people who hate Reno are aggro players  In fact  I think most of the time theyre people who play midrange decks and simply cant keep up  and even some control players who are often at a disadvantage because of the sudden health increase  As for the one ofs and lack of enough answers  Reno Jackson more than makes up for it  provided you draw it  which I again admit is more of a problem against aggro  But frankly  deck building skill doesnt even matter because most Reno players  like aggro players  or players of any common archetype really  netdeck their deck from a legend player anyway  The only complaint here is that aggro players dont deserve to complain about Reno Decks  because they play face cancer and often win anyway  And while I think frankly anybody can complain about losing to Reno  my argument was against your sudden dismissal of any complaint about reno as salty noskill aggro bitching  which was  by the way  incorrect  and also super annoying\", \"commentId\": \"22488\", \"commentDate\": \"1467903788\"}, {\"comment\": \"Its not hypocritical to complain
