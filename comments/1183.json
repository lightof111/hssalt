Im incredibly unlucky with Barnes   On streams and when facing other people who run him I constantly see these like insane pulls and meanwhile I get simple 11 bodies and have been screwed over by Doomsayer  twice  I mean come on I run  Ragnaros  Lightlord Cairne Bloodhoof Tirion Fordring Sylvanas Windrunner which are all great pulls and ALOT of spells  The only time I pulled something nice was a Tirion Fordring which I do admit is the best one  not in that situation but still but that was versus the luckiest resurrect priest is the universe so I lost that one anyway  And Im not butthurt when it comes down to that sort of thing  because I realise you shouldnt whine about bad RNG if you put the cards in your deck yourself thats why I dont whine about the countless times I got screwed over by my own yogg but I do whine about losing a mirror because I pull an Aldor Peacekeeper while my opponent pulls a Cairne Bloodhoof\", \"commentId\": \"24725\", \"commentDate\": \"1472125554\"},

instantly concede  cant win  I can literally beat anything else in the game EASILY  Please prove me wrong  show me a game where resurrect priest had turn 3 blademaster into resurrect and then lost the

are fast decks and efficient usually    so then you can play whatever you want on ladder   i think thats the smart way to do it  instead trying to rank up whit a concede deck   of course there are aggro and netdecks on bad rank so you see its about the player too   Pass rank 5 you see alot of different decks because some dont really care about legend since the reward is almost the same  I for example reached rank 5 last season whit a tempo mage   this season whit a midrange hunter   both proved to be solid  now i can mess around whit yogg n load   control mage and such  I guess some here
