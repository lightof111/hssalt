types on a childrens card game  but one relies on early game synergies to finish a game fast while the other relies on small minion synergies to win a value game  The third option is a child rapist and the fourth option is a bunch of organic matter in an advanced state of decomposition   Id say the third option does have some repulsion on my part mostly because I dont like little kids  The other options have no measure of repulsion whatsoever  Hope I helped \", \"commentId\": \"37985\", \"commentDate\": \"1495709002\"}, {\"comment\": \"why cant I ever build an even decent deck How come this

nerfed  Any rank obtained playing it is meaningless  Its a bit like the old huntertaker or secret Paladin or Pirate Warrior people will play it and rank up  but they can never admit to playing it without getting laughed at because those are decks that a badly programmed bot will grind to legend  Unless Im holding complete disruption in my opening hand I just concede turn 1 to crystal rogue  The sad pathetic little fucks who play it arent worth my time   Things that can fuck up or disrupt crystal rogue are dirty rat to pull bounce cards or cards they want to bounce later  transform cards like hex devolve and potion of polymorph  and mass removal like dragon fire equality pyromancer and volcano  Or smorc them down  but thats as bad as playing quest rogue\", \"commentId\": \"37987\",

shot  In 3 or so hours I have encountered 1 priest  aggro and a quest warrior  Quest warrior wad decent  but I hate the rng of 8 damage into random enemy  Yogg was bad  but this is barely better  Then the quest rogue that stalls for few moments then dumps 55 boars with charge for 1 mana  aggro druid dropping 33 adapt minion on the first turn that keeps adapting every time it hits your face  4 mana  summon 4x 22  then buff them next turn for 1 mana  and more aggro  Then I learned that packs costs were increased and to make things better we will have no more adventures  but more expansions  a k a give us more money  Ranked even at lvl 19 consists of top 5 copypasted decks  casual is the same  I see no improvements at all  in fact game seems even worse than I remembered it  I had a brief experience with Gwent and TESLegends  both have some really interesting ideas and mechanics  but HS is still a turd  targeted at stupid audience  that is unable to find better alternatives  Well  good

reason why Northshire Cleric gets removed 80 of the time even when there are more threatening minions on the board is cause she sucks     A few days ago I had a Mage throw a Fireball on her    You know 4 mana to remove a 1 cost minion     How exactly are Drakonid Operative and Kabal Talonpriest bad minions    Im sorry but I fail to see how Shadow Word Death and Shadow Word Pain are shitty removal    Since when Dragonfire Potion is a bad AOE    Yes it will most likely clear your board as well but how many minions can survive 5 damage on turn 6     And all this comes from someone that doesnt even play Priest that much    Sure the class has its weaknesses but so do the other 8     Priest isnt probably game breaking but its certainly in a better spot than Warlock right now\",
