the occasional tempo mage  all who just dump burn in your face   I never really get mad  but Im just not having fun with this game anymore  Perhaps a break is in order\", \"commentId\": \"24988\",

warrior and Nzoth priest  TBH Im not really even trying  just surfing Hearthpwn and Youtube and clicking in to do my turns  I can understand your frustration but all decks in Hearthstone require skill  Face decks take more skill than most people think because you have to decide when to use your cards and there are many more possible plays  Often when playing priest I only have one viable play every turn and I dont have to think at all  Id rather lose a 5 minute game to a face deck than a 30 min game to a control deck\", \"commentId\": \"24991\", \"commentDate\": \"1472443082\"}, {\"comment\": \"So heres a little Rant guess  keep in mind this is what i see as of right now  Casual mode is a completely and total cancer right now  there is literally no one on that play mode that plays for fun or they create their own decks  This upsets me greatly because i am actually those kind of people who actually think of decks themselves and its not very fun to play someone who just netdecked off a popular website and they farm casual mode  So about an hour ago i played against a guy who got turn 6 lethal in the top 9 cards of his decks  he was a pretty shitty player in my book  but lucky for him  i had a bad opener and he had 4 burn spells in the top 10 cards  the match before I play against someone who was playing Aggro Warrior and he got lucky and killed me in his top 11 cards because he drew reaper with Double upgrade and both heroic strikes   I added the guy playing tempo mage because i will admit i am salty and i just wanted to unleash my stress on him and he acted like a punk claiming i am a crybaby because i lost  which is a dumb thing to say because its Casual mode  which i explained to him  im just curious to why hes playing the most Cliche tempo mage in Casual mode when ranked can accept the same results  keep in mind this guy is Ranked 6 I point that out to him and he pulls the old well youre only ranked 14  thats what happens when tryhards get caught on how big of douchebag they are step 1 you ask them why they are playing a netdeck in casual mode their answer im doing quests  step  you say ranked mode also does quests so thats a lame excuse to be playing that  their Answer excuse after excuse you do get those assholes who act all tough and say keep cry  you suck at this game Which is kinda funny because its ironic they are being the assholes who are playing Casual mode because they are insecure about their skill level  You know what tho  I give kudos to those players who actually are of what they are doing and they play ranked mode because they know what is what  even if you play ranked 2015 with a fun deck  you are a better person than those cancers in casual mode   Im serious about the fact Blizzard needs to change the format and make Ranked mode more rewarding to players other than cardbacks and cheap chests  Give them more gold if they go on a winning Streak or if they rank up give them 10 gold    I love hearthstone and there are times where i want to brainstorm decks  but you cant do it because there is a good amount of people who take this game wayyyyy to seriously and play netdecks in casual mode  I could talk about a whole another page for what i think people who netdeck and talk shit  but i will save that for another day \", \"commentId\": \"24992\", \"commentDate\": \"1472443880\"}, {\"comment\": \"do

work out how to play the deck that every second streamer has been featuring for weeks on end     So I rope back on the following turns because clearly the retard needs 70 seconds to decide to play

important for aggro shaman  The idea is to predict how youll curve out  and also to make situational picks  For instance  last time I had a really good opener with the coin  tunnel trogg and lightning bolt  I was playing versus another shaman which ofcourse was another aggro shaman and because my hand was so good I decided to keep lightning bolt  Turn one he played tunnel trogg  turn one I played tunnel trogg coin lightning bolt followed by a turn two squire  Small keeps like that can win you the game  2  Know when to trade and when to go face  Especially in the beginning making favourable trades is important  but when it comes to the lategame and your opponent is starting to outvalue you  you cant afford to make these trades anymore except maybe if you have lifetap from finley  Thats the general rule to follow  but exceptions do exist   3  Overload is a very simple mechanic  but can screw you over if you screw up  Things like playing overload on turn 4 when you have doomhammer  or coining totem golem when you have a flame juggler and no one drops on turn one  4  Sometimes I win matchups I wouldve lost if I had simply made the obvious play  The best example Turn 4 77 Slam it  But if that 77 screws up your curve  or youre playing versus a tempo magectrl warrior who hasnt shown any answers yet you might want to hold back\", \"commentId\": \"25003\", \"commentDate\":
