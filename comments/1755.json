hit Rank 6 on my ongoing journey to Rank 5  Its always a streak at 6 stars that gets interrupted and sets me back to nothing  Either the luckiest draws from my opponent  bad draw on my part but mostly both  If Im facing mostly aggro I switch to an antiaggro deck just to face controlmidrange and other such situations\", \"commentId\": \"36820\", \"commentDate\": \"1494185225\"}, {\"comment\": \"This
