"[{\"comment\": \"I enjoy every story about a yoggusers fail   Im just afraid that they didnt hit that clown with the nerfhammer hard enough  I mean after the Nat Pagle nerf no one played him  and Yogg might be still good enough on average  at least in some decks  I had way too many loss against that joke card in situations that couldnt be lost otherwise  I hate it with passion\",

my board   Okay   Fine  I played an Azure Drake  drew into a second Arcane Giant cost down to 0 each  played a Swashburglar  which gave me that 34 Taunt Monkey from the Warrior class      Great  Perfect   Just what I needed to block that Cthun and win     Pass turn  Opponent plays Yogg  and he casts maybe 3 or 4 spells  which do nothing much  except one of them was a Sap which didnt pick one of my two giants  my drake  or the swashburglar  but instead picks the Taunt Monkey and Cthun slaps me for 10   Couldnt have been more perfect  I guess  but to be fair I was just as lucky being given the Taunt Monkey in the first place  though I had Yogg in my hand and opted to make a play rather than throwing my hands up and letting RNGesus take the wheel   My mistake   Still  since I had Yogg in my deck and simply opted not to use him at that point  I guess this is still a tale of YoggUser Fail  so once again  enjoy\", \"commentId\": \"26811\", \"commentDate\": \"1476002668\"}, {\"comment\": \"Hehe   sorry but this doesnt count  I meant that I enjoy when someone plays Yogg and fails with it  On the other hand  I cant say I feel sorry for you  since you have also decided to include Yogg in your deck  Anyways  thanks for sharing  Dont forget to disenchant your Yogg until its full dust value \", \"commentId\": \"26812\", \"commentDate\": \"1476003317\"}, {\"comment\": \"I am a F2P and I have only a few cards for classes like hunter  warlock and mage  But I can win in casual for quests against tier 2 and tier 1 decks with mostlybasic decks  The idea is to play an unexpected strategy  not to play basic tempo based decks  What I mean is not using a basic deck recommended by pros and adding a few better cards to it  For example  I play a basic spell damage druid with Geomancer  Ogre Magi  Azure Drake or shaman with lot of tokens and double Bloodlust  It feels really nice when you defeat Control Warriors or Midrange Shamans with such garbage decks  \", \"commentId\": \"26813\",
