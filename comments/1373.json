simple and face oriented decks  They win  no matter how bad they play  Fantastic job Blizzard  there was actually some hope that this expansion end up being good  but you just had to keep an overpowered face deck alive  so you dont lose the money from all the idiots who wouldnt be able to get past rank 20 without it  Edit 3 more of them  all 3 had perfect start Buccaneer into War Axe
