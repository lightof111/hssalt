"[{\"comment\": \"Great design with Reno Blizz  Create a card where people have to build the most inconsistent deck possible so that its impossible to play around anything  Does this Renolock magically have 5 AOE cards or just a bunch of healing crap Will this Reno mage draw Reno by T8 even though he plays no draw whatsoever Theres no way of knowing  So youre forced to play a bullshit RNG game instead of actually being skillful and playing around things  Ive played Reno decks before too  Its pretty much just I hope I get the card I need right now every turn\", \"commentId\": \"33477\",

dont know is it cause some streamer played it Or is it cause its favored against those Jade Druids that are supposed to be flooding the ladder but that I still havent seen any of Can someone please

streak due to the game freezing on the opponents turn  or at least I think I lost the win streak as after several minutes waiting for the opponents turn to end I logged out  Logging back in didnt give any notice that a previous game was recorded  but based on stars the game was recorded as a loss    What sucks is that for me the game seemed to work perfectly  I could chat with my friend through the game chat  but the opponents turn just would not end and the cards were stuck in the air  Update Won the next two  but then when was about to get a new win streak lost one  So now Im rank 8  4 stars

a weapon and added 1 mana  classes like warlock and mage can basically play an AOE every turn until you run out of cards right now  the next expansion also adds more aoe cards e g  volcano  neutral heal and neutral armor especially is something i wouldnt mind  the new priest quest goes into that direction setting your hero HP to 40 turning around the game more than reno and you can more reliably aquire it by turn 6 to 10 without highlander inconsistency if we see a 1 mana priest deathrattle card released this might actually be insane and there might be a fatigue meta incoming not very likely

{\"comment\": \"are you playing wild coz there is no paladin in standard on EU at all  the only person who touches paladin right now is me  and i dont even run DF in my latest murloc paladin but 2x small time recruits instead which seems better vs early doomsayer turns against control and better vs aggro in the lategame since it cant end up dead after you had to skip using it to keep up the tempo  it gives you the OP one drops rather than 3 randomly costed cards and thus you can gain way more tempo  as onedrops are the most overstated tempo cards e g  13 stats  4 stats for 1 mana or the 21 murloc that gives a 11 buff thats 5 stats for 1 mana or argent squire is like a 22 for 1 as well coz the divine shield kinda duplicates your 11  abusive sergeant is like a 31 etc    if you scale that up on the mana curve only millhouse mana storm and maybe piloted shredder are on par stats wise  but MH has a downside that makes it unplayable and shredder is slow due to the deathrattle and its not in standard anymore\", \"commentId\": \"33494\", \"commentDate\": \"1489258901\"}, {\"comment\": \"yes but this was in arena\", \"commentId\": \"33495\", \"commentDate\": \"1489259388\"},
