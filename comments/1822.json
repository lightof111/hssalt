spending money on this game  The game has become such a waste of time  This game was so good until the expansions f everything up  All these decks I mentioned have some incredibly broken cards that make the game so incredible snowball heavy  There is no room for people who enjoy creating decks with never before seen cards  From hundreds of matches played  Everyone is playing the same decks  No one has the balls to challenge the netdecking scum with some original decks Why Because this game has the most terrible balance in card game history  How is it possible that someone who goes second can have a 42 waraxe  a 53 pirate  a 11 pirate  and a 34 pirate on turn 3 Is this supposed to be fun What Im so confused  Even when I watch my favorite youtubers  I cant watch more then 5 minutes  Its

gokla  2 x doomer sayer and crapped on the meta at rank 2 to 1  I went on a winning streak of 120 because the MMR system couldnt process my deck info  That was yesterday   The deck shits on mid range pally  secret mage and pirate warriors and to some degree token druid and all othet aggro devks  But weak again other slow and control and valued decks   Although guess what after that The MMR started matching my games with all slow decks today like JadeDruid JadeShaman and Dragon control Priest  Decks I have not seen for ages   Is the MMR system rigged Thats the question I want to ask you after reading the above  I Reckon there are few blizzard employees that checks the winning to losing reports of decks daily and any decks that have strong winning ratios against the current meta the tweaks are to the MMA algorithms and maybe thats why the nerf sometimes are slow for over powered cards because things can be adjusted on blizzard ends without actually nerfing the card  You just getting match with unfavourable matches   Also  after I went on a 5 games winning streak at rank 2  Mulligan stage became really weird  I would draw 2 x truesilver going 1st or 2 x concretion or 2 x something consistently  And if I  Mulligan a card away I would then redraw the 2nd copy of that card  And this happened in quite a number of games  Weird huh\", \"commentId\": \"38215\", \"commentDate\":
