unironically even though he had to make ZERO decisions  Just now  I lost to a dragon priest  who had to make ZERO decisions  all he had to do was play obvious minions on curve  I actually made some pretty tough calculations Im proud of that match  I calculated different probabilities  and made some counterintuitive optimal plays based on very small percentual differences  I know thats taking it a bit too far but I sometimes like playing like that   What did he do Snap play T1 Whelp T2 Agent T3 Talonpriest T4 Guardian T5 DrakOP on and on  Him saying Well played at the end literally made me swear at my screen  Youd think a rank 3 player would have to make SOME KIND of decision  I know dragon priest isnt generally seen as cancer  but I hate it so much  I recall Hotform confirming my perception of it yesterday Dragon priest is a deck that doesnt require any decision making  It just requires you to play on curve  Now he went as far as saying its easier than pirate warrior  but I wont say that yet\", \"commentId\": \"33851\", \"commentDate\": \"1489920962\"}, {\"comment\": \"Hi all  RAAAAAAAAAAAAGE I dont know how play in this game  really  I play at dragon priest  i lose  I

placed on the field before the finja and its victim are removed from the board   Since theyre still on the board  Finja gets the buff from the Warleader thus meaning the Finja effectively gets an
