against QR  Back in gadgetzan I was fed up with PW because of its aggressive start  but I could still do something about it  QR showed up and I just sigh every time  when I face one  Do you know how many times the rogue player made a mistake like a really big one and still managed to win  because of the cheap 55s  either flooding the board or charging towards the face I believe  you do  Or with Swashburglar and they summoning tentacles  murlocs    etc  I still dont understand why people defend the deck  of course it dies to the meta  because the meta is what actually counters it  If the people  who defended the QR deck  played a deck other than a one  that tries to kill the opponent by t5 aka aggro  they will see how unfair QR actually is  Rant over\", \"commentId\": \"38227\",

arguably that there are too many threat cards with low mana cost  If you cant deal with this on turn 2 from either a bad mulligan or whatever  a warleader turn 3 gives a 2 drop 12 face damage  and then theres adapt your murlocs on turn 4 etc  Id much prefer to see some more defensive Murloc cards like Coldlight Seer and Hydrologists\", \"commentId\": \"38233\", \"commentDate\": \"1496153473\"},

is a mess  you can only win if you play 1 of 3 classes   Skill has all but gone and now only luck  random effects and going first with a good hand wins most of the games    warlock is still pretty

psychological phenomenon where an individual will assume one outcome is more prevalent than another simply because they pay more attention to that outcome  usually because it has a bigger impact on them  Additionally  negative situations have a bigger impact on most people than positive ones  Its painfully obvious to me that you all do not pay much attention when you play games in a positive matchup  but when you are in a negative matchup especially multiple in a row you get upset and remember it  and conspiracy theories are born\", \"commentId\": \"38238\", \"commentDate\":
