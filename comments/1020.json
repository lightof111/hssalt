also entertaining  But currently its just crazy how much complete bullshit is written in here  I know that people can post their honest opinion here without being criticised but still I had to make this post  1st of all I get it when people in here rage about top tier decks because it sometimes is really frustrating  But raging about these is apparently not enough  There are rage posts about almost every single card  class  gamemode in this thread  Ive seen giant paladin getting shittalked aswell as cabalists tome  a lot of hate on priest although i have to say i respect priest players right now for playing what they like and not necessarly for what is powerful  There is just so much hate on things that are completely fine that i really had to imagine the lifes  faces behind these posts  because I just couldnt  Understand what they were thinking  Are you people really thinking that every of your losses is due to a  A ridiculous curve  b  an op deck  card  or c  RNG But every single win is because of skill Thats the only explaination I have for all those shitty posts   So I wanna ask you all 1 question  what has to happen  that after a loss you respect your opponent and give him an honest gg\", \"commentId\": \"21274\", \"commentDate\": \"1465277566\"}, {\"comment\": \"Shaman decks are a cancer upon this game now  Little to no skill is required due to OPd monsters

decided to spent all of June focusing on just Wild  I have a few Priest decks that Ive adapted to include Wild cards  Ill start with the pleasant 1  The Wild Meta is rather diverse  Ive been seeing all sorts of strange decks as I climb  Its been an extremely refreshing change of pace from seeing the same decks in Standard  Now that I got that out of the way  here is some salt 1  Against Tempo Mage Not much happening in the early game  Turn 4 the Mage plays Double Unstable Portal and this is where the fun begins  Double Ysera  they coin the first one out on Turn 5 and then drop the second one on Turn 6  That essentially sealed the game in their favor and destroyed my win streak  2  Against Freeze Mage Removed his Emp T after the first tick  Cleared Alexastraza and healed myself back up to 21  Ive seen them use quite a few spells due to the pressure Im putting on board so Im thinking things are looking good  My pressure is KT and constantly resurrecting Cultists  Shades  Belchers  Ive healed a bit more as well  The Mage then drops Malygos  Frost Bolt and Ice Lance All discounted from the earlier Emperor and drops me to 4 health  I clear Malygos with the minions I have on board  pop the Ice Block leaving them at 2 health and let KT resurrect my minions again and I heal to 8 Justicar Heropower  Im left hoping they dont have 8 damage as this Mage is Secretless and sitting at 2 health  Mage topdecks something and then the Mage starts spamming emotes  Turns out the topdeck is the second Frost Bolt  pairs it with the Ice Lance in hand and then pings me with the hero power  Utter bullshit  out of every deck in the game Freeze Mage is my most despised  Lost this game as well\", \"commentId\": \"21289\", \"commentDate\": \"1465310384\"}, {\"comment\": \"So  what specifically are you loosing to  Can you pinpoint the exact play or moves that are nailing you in all these cookie cutter decks  If so  youve half the info sort out the problems youre facing   If you take an angry mindset into the next game  youre prone to lose   You seem like you take the game seriously  but dont you think part of your solution is managing your frustration  For my own mindset  I nerdrage everytime I lose to a Pirate Warrior stemming from the fact I suck at playing them myself  so made a few deck changes and racked up a few wins\", \"commentId\": \"21290\", \"commentDate\":
