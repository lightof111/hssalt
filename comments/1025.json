"[{\"comment\": \"Did I ever say control warrior isnt braindead Because it is  The only control warrior matchup that requires thought is the mirror or perhaps vs a Nzoth deckpriest  But dont pretend shaman takes skill  Ive played it to rank 3 and quit because it was too boring  Its easy af  Nothing more than playing your minions on curve  making favourable trades and bursting your opponent down with skillhammer and spells in the lategame  And yes  shadow word pain is just as skillfull as totem golem  There are very few times where the first turns actually take skill  Skill comes in lategame when you play a control deck  when you play aggro shaman it never comes in  Aggro decks has a layer of thinking that doesnt exist in control deck  which is what threat should i drop  and does he have the AoE clear because control decks dont have to think about what minion to drop  playing around clears and not overextending  right If you pretend aggro shaman takes skill youre delusional  This comes from a guy whos played pretty much every deck  The only decks I can think of that are easier than aggro shaman are CThun druid and aggro warrior  I see your comment as nothing more than an excuse to feel good about playing a cancer deck\", \"commentId\": \"21375\", \"commentDate\": \"1465462566\"}, {\"comment\": \"Are you guys on the same server FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT\", \"commentId\":

much thinking as control decks  GTFO with that logic  But the real issue is  that in a fair game a deck costing max 2000 dust should not be able to get to legend so efficiently  The fact that aggro decks are efficient and cost little is so unfair  that this thread has reached 1030 pages  I would appreciate aggro as a tactic if it was high riskhigh reward  but with such high winrates as opposed to control decks makes it unfair  Aggro deck players should be competing at lower ranks  period\", \"commentId\": \"21384\", \"commentDate\": \"1465472186\"}, {\"comment\": \"wow such a big tread lets
