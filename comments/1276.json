deck  evertything i try on ladder gets crushed by discard zoo cancer2  typical aggro shamans fuck 122 curve  ludicrous hunters  barnes  highmane  arcane giant druids    Im not salty because i lost around 8 games straight  im fucking mad that i cant create one single legit deck  everything that i improvise just gets shit on by some net deck aggro nonsense  I spent a shitload of time researching the meta trying to find some way to build a somewhat cheap competivie deck what i ended up with was a dragon warrior got me to rank9 80 winrate season before ners  it just seemed so optimized and had many cool interaction  but now all i face on ladder rank 1916 is 60 midrange hunters all the exact same deck 20 zoo discard blizzard TT 15 aggro shamans and 5 everything else  I fucking wish i was sarcastic   If i was bad at this game id be ok  by my hell some decks are just so high reward low risk  they punish you  you lose  they can make some bad plays and still win cough hunter  Ive tried so far 1 classical warrior lists  dragon warrior  dragon priest  dragon mage  mediv tempo mage  midrange mage  midrange dragon paladin  resurrect priest  otk priest  tempo mage  beast druid and everything cthun no veklor  Regardless of this  blizzard has made some hughe mistakes because this game is really far from diverse  and playrs like myself who want to push their skill to the limit are met with just basically 34 98 identical decks  its not unwinable ofc  but my winrate vs these top tier decks is about 50  and i see people make misplays and still win all the time  just because their decks are so forgiving  Bottom line is  being unique and creative even just a bit lends you a sub optimal deck incapable of climbing past rank 10   if anyone has some advice please pm me rant off\",

frustrates me so much  I dont expect not to lose  but some games i cant do anything but get steam coming off my ears  I have uninstalled hs like 20 times  but I always reinstall it in the mood ill play it chill and cool  but when i lose to druids that nourish for mana and dont hero power with the rest 2 mana  when I draw my first auctioneer in 20 cards when I play miracle rogue  when i cant find excute in 20 cards for enemy antonidas I feel Ill have a stroke  I give a lot of time to this game  believeing deep inside that skill matters at some point  I watch streams and i dont think Im that bad of a player and i cant see it as anything else than a competitive game not meaning money or anything  just that the better player wins  Then i wonder how some people get to legend every season and I think that they are actually outplaying the opponent by being better  Then i try to but in a game where rng is located from the matchups you will meet in ladder to the order the cards are in your deck and nearly every turn of the game  I cant seem to keep it together\", \"commentId\": \"26775\", \"commentDate\": \"1475870540\"}, {\"comment\": \"Ive seen a nice budget dragon priest
