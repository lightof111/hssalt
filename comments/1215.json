if you draw perfectly as so many hunters seem to do  then its almost impossible for you to lose  assuming youre not braindead  With hunters its always the same predictable shit  turn 1 fiery bat turn 2 huge toad or elekk turn 3 animal companion turn 4 infested wolf turn 6 highmane turns 8 and 9 CotW   Aggro shamans are in a similar situation with their turn 1 trogg  turn 2 golem  etc etc  Theyre really almost mindless decks and beyond powerful  People are getting tired of it  Tired of both their power levels if they draw well and of the predictability  Ive stopped playing midrange hunter altogether because I always win too much games when I do play it  Feels like cheating\", \"commentId\": \"25471\", \"commentDate\": \"1473194071\"}, {\"comment\": \"Wasnt going at each other against the rules of the thread  Meh  Wont lie  I tolerate a great deal and I win most of my games but when I do lose its because my opponent got lucky and got exactly the card he needed five times in a row while I draw jack dick  and if even one card even of us was different and broke the chain hed get crushed  That makes me salty  Oh  Enemy tempo mage got both mirror entities and topdecked exact lethal because Rag Lightlord would change nothing for me  Also I didnt draw my eater of secrets  I guess I was out skilled  Then again the games Wizard Poker so what the hell  If I want a one on one duel of
