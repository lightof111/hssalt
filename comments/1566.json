opponents get  I am by no means a bad arena player but my god my last three drafts has been so poor its ridicoules  In my latest run it got a to choose a legendary for the first time in a while Motherfucking cho  patches and sgt sally as a Priest  I got one 34 thing and a chow otherwise my deck was garbage and all my 2 drops sucked more or less  What do I face Motherfucking premium 1 drops  2 drops and 3 drops  Do I have a clear to deal with them No  and I cant motivate myself to play ladder at the moment  So I am officially unstalling HS for a while as I keep coming back to the game thinking Yea  its gonna be alright today  a couple of games later same bullshit  I play a lot of different decks Reno Priest and Renolock  some shadow priest as well  a bit of Rogue  Dragon Priest  Pirate warrior mostly when I get warrior quests and even a buffadin deck  And what happens I draw all my late game cards and its no because my lists are that greedy or my opponents draws fucking amazing openers everytime  Managed to play a dragon priest deck where I didnt draw a dragon until turn 6 or something and it was not the reno deck  I played a jade druid deck where I didnt play a jade until turn motherfucking 6  Even a Pirate Warrior deck where I managed one single minion until I conceded at turn 6 or 7 but okay I thought of that as karma for playing that deck  I also had a game where I played against a pirate warrior where I managed to draw ALL my late game cards without drawing a single early game card until I was dead at turn 4 or 5 A dragon priest deck with six 5drops  two 6drops and three 4drops\", \"commentId\": \"32898\", \"commentDate\": \"1488207159\"}, {\"comment\": \"This seems like bad timing  Were about to have an expansion  maybe you should wait for a

this METALooks like decks that win now  are specifically made by Blizz to work  Focusing on them for last expansions  pissing on the rest  So what works now   Reno decks  u need Reno for them to work   and its the wors feeling ever playing against this deck Even when ure not racing  slowly whittling down your opponent  he can drop the reno just before hes dead  and start this bullshit all over again  If u dont have card draw  or strong board at this moment  Ure screwed  Some of them fucking clone Renoreturn them to hands  How fucked up is that Pirate  take all Pirate cards  and put them in a class with low cost weapons  profit Dragon fucking priest  hate this fucking shit almost as much as reno  OVERSTATTED cards which take so much of your resources to go through    If a priest can have a 2 mana 24 with tound  why cant Paladin have a 42 with stealth  5 mana 56 with card draw  Which other class has so imbalanced stats on their cards ah yes    the other op class  Shammy Cant wait till all these fucked up cards phase out from Standard  Its probably still going to be shit  but youre be able to create and compete with decks that are not specially cut for you by Blizzard

Easy Mode mechanic intentionally created to make it possible for new players to obtain a cheapish  simple deck to play competitively right away  Rotations wont prevent this  and I dont have much confidence that they know how to boost a weak class without giving it something utterly stupid to drag it quickly back to a competitive level  Which is to say  we should prepare for a dirt cheap weapon for both Hunter  Paladin so they can get back into the meta with their own version of pirate decks  GGWP  Team 5  GGWP   Meta is trash  especially in standard  I queued into 4 games today  The first 2 were in standard casual    both pirate warriors  I said Fit  may as well just play ranked so I did    aggro shaman and a super low cost buffadin kudos for doing something different  at least
