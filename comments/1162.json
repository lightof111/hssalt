running low Mage  Poly op  burn op  flamewalker rngheavy  flamestrike op  secrets op What else Mill gets hate  because people cant play against it  any t1 deck gets hate  same for every aggro deck or heavy control fights too long  fatigue  Elyse rngheavy  tempo kinda died in standard  so people try to mix it with aggro and get hate  You need a deck with zero rng impossible  card draw is rng and people will complain if you draw well  zero burn  zero removal  not too fast  not too slow too much healing is a nono  very few spells ideally no spells  weak creatures  no combos  Basically a deck that will not threat them at any point and give them a fast and easy win  Still  I can imagine someone coming here and complaining about weird and unpredictable opponent\", \"commentId\": \"24283\",
