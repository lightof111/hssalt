think Miracle Rogue is the new most popular deck played at least on my server  Its like every 3rd game is rogue and about 80 of those rogues are Miracle decks so     Id like to know where all the

standard  all you see is a wave of idiotic Pirate Warriors and Shamans  When you leave Standard and head for Wild as I did  the bullshit continues  I have faced probably about 7580 Pirate Warriors in about 2 months of playing Wild  These decks are so dumb  so pointless  and so ridiculously easy to play that the only way to climb is to play the deck that the poor excuses for players are  or something that directly counters them which usually loses to every other deck  And the problem is that Blizzard is too damn lazy to fix these stupid ass Pirates  particularly in Wild  If I never saw a single SMOrc deck again  Id be quite satisfied with the ladder experience  But this retarded bullshit that Blizzard CONTINUALLY PUTS INTO THE GAME and then never fixes is so dumb  They need to remember that PEOPLE PLAY WILD TOO AND MORE PEOPLE ARE STARTING BECAUSE STANDARD IS SO SHITTY  They cant just use it as a place to dump all of their broken shit  The developers themselves said that they wanted to wait to release Patches until SHIPS CANNON ROTATED OUT  Wild is still a mode  Blizzard  Recognize your mistakes and fix them  People with zero skill  ambition  and intelligence should not be ruling the Standard and Wild ladders  STOP THIS POINTLESS BS AND GIVE THE ACTUAL PLAYERS A CHANCE\", \"commentId\": \"31132\", \"commentDate\": \"1484689490\"}, {\"comment\": \"Gadgetzan

and they draw terribly   I am so ucking tired of Warriors and their board flood and weapon buff by turn 2  Turn Fucking 2 the game is over   Really  This is good for the game  The other extreme is that cock sucker Reno shit where Warlocks ALWAYS get Reno in time and they have numerous ways to clear the board   There is NO penalty to play Reno   Fucking NONE   It ruins the game  No oen plays
