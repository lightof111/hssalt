the usual 5 quest rogues in a row  I destroyed them all and loved it  What made me salty was 1 star from rank 5 and I get a jade druid  Really That asshole couldnt find something new to try Freeze mage goes back forever but at least it uses the newest expansion  I thought maybe I would have him after I alexd but he armored up and then played that card that buffs a minion and adds that much armor  He ended up with something like 33 health after that plus I used all my stalls  I just got pissed and closed the ipad and put it away  Not even a concede for that douche  let him sit and

the quest needs to modified either by stating the quest can be completed using only Rogue cards or using nonrogue cards  They should not be allowed to steal opponents cards AND be able to complete the
