played these days    i wont complain about the meta or the decks used but what really pisses me off is seeing this crap on casual mode   since the release of msg i decided i will only run decks that i might see fun regardless of there win potential and specially since they will be played on casual mode win rate wont really bother me   but facing meta decks even on casual is just plain dumb  want to be competitive take ur crap to the ladder   no point of grinding these decks on casual but again this is me just wishing and blowing off some steam\", \"commentId\": \"30416\", \"commentDate\":
