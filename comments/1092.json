called Confirmation bias and Post hoc reasoning  The first means you will see what you expect to see  interpret those observations in a way that supports those expectations and subconsciously disregard data in conflict with those assumptions  We tend to overinflate the perceived tendency of something to happen that we expect by many times their actual frequency  Your 90 is very likely to be much  much lower  if you would actually systematically count them over a period of time  The second is the tendency to link two unrelated events as having a causal relationship on no other basis than that they follow each other in time  This is almost never true  but we think it is  How can you make a connection between their greetings and their hand On what basis can we assume they have anything with each other to do  Especially since you have to play the same people a large number of times in close succession to even be able to notice any such patterns  much less determine if they are actually true  And that presupposes that we can determine if they have a bad hand or not in relation to the quality of their deck and their skill But I agree with the annoyance of people just leaving  I expect they are playing from a phone and when they give up they simply turn it off  instead of conceding  Its no excuse  but it might be an explanation  \", \"commentId\": \"22790\",

last game triggered me more than any game ive ever played before  Im playing a simple dragon warrior on a f2p after hitting legend on my main  everything is good and well  i start a game and face a mage   I get the worst hand imaginable Rag  Grom  2 Executes and stare angrily at the screen waiting for the mana wyrm turn 1  My opponent plays the wyrm and im left without a answer The games plays out and thanks to some good topdecks i can come back So  i have 3 minions  and my enemy has nothing left on the board  neither on the hand  HeSheIt topdecks Yogg and i just feel sad because every Yogg before fucked me up badly  Yogg proceeds to clear my board  heal my enemy back to 9 hp  gets CoTW and 2 taunt wolves WoTOG buff and draws 2 cards CabTomeIm left speechless and angry until my enemy heropowers innervate herself in the face accident  bm i dont know while spamming sorry So i notice the 8 hp and dont see me topdecking ragnaros I press concede and nothing happens  try again and then I notice ragnaros  After reconnecting I play ragnaros and end my turnit gets copied from mirror It hits face and im left staring at the screen and wondering what happened   That game left me more

to alter the win percentage of decks in such a way that people will be encouraged to play and thus ultimately buy the current expansion  Blizzard might be perfectly happy to have the matchmaking favour some decks over others provided they are the decks featuring the cards they want to sell  My logic also explains why Blizzard will let broken cards run so long before they nerf them  they most likely track sales rates on packs featuring chances to get the broken cards  only once sales slow and most everyone whos going to buy the cancer cards has purchased  only then they nerf    And soon after release the next broken set that people will want jump on  Blizzard are not going to get into a situation where people can ignore the latest expansion by playing an effective deck from existing cards     Regardless of whether or not you are intelligent enough to understand this reasoning  the fact remains that a statistical examination of the type of deck faced indicates evidence for nonrandom matchmaking and some sort of hidden mechanism related to the deck you yourself are running  Now go troll for Blizzard somewhere else\", \"commentId\": \"22801\", \"commentDate\":

enough to create an AI that analyze EACH deck that are coming to a ranked play  determined WHICH kind of deck it is considering many players can play it with so many different variations and is able
