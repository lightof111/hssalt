with this stupid netdeckers    I mean okey  if you wanna ty out your own decks so be it  Im fine with archetype copys with 5070 the same cards    the card pool is limited and it can be fun to refine a deck  And of course it also fun to play the deck from another player to try something different  But FUCK IT it is so boring with this I copy 100 of this deck because some random people said it is the best deck right now and all idiots PLAY THE FUCKING SAME DECK  AFTER 3 GAMES YOU CAN LITERARY CALL EVERY FUCKING CARD IN THEIR ENTIRE DECK  Quest Rogue isnt the fucking best deck right now  Quest Warrior and this zoolike Druid either  The fuck noone knows what the best fucking deck right now I would still suggest it is the fucking pirate warrior and you are to stupid to play the deck you played the entire last month  stop playing all the same fucking shit  Show some creativity  try something new out  Pirate Warrior isnt cancer  Quest Rogue isnt cancer  Midrange shaman wasnt cancer
