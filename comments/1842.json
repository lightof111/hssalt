design of control decks in this meta   I used to play almost all control decks  and now theyre all abominations   Mage has the most RNG of any highlevel deck in the history of the game   Warrior has gone from one of the most rewarding and challenging decks to play taunts  flip coins   The only proactive plays Priest has are RNGbased   Paladin is possibly the last true control deck  but its also pretty darn boring   And if you want to try a good old NZoth or CThun Warrior  Enjoy autolosses against Jades  quest Rogue  Taunt Warrior and all the other recent design achievements\", \"commentId\":

playing for 3 years and i love the cards but after watching the last 3 tournaments it did not take me long to commit to this decision   high rolls and too much swings kill strategy and counter plays
