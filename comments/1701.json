why you wouldnt be a little bit concerned with trying to make all quests equally playable  I really really want The Marsh Queen to work but its just really  really bad  or at least hunter doesnt yet have the tools to make it work  The result of their inability to balance or test is that in the time since the new expansion launched  I have played probably 150 games or more  and seen the druid quest literally twice  the warlock quest once  the hunter quest 3 times  the paladin quest about the same   shaman quest less than 10 times  the priest quest a reasonable amount of times  mage quite a bit for a few days then it disappeared completely  and both rogue and warrior utterly through the roof  The result is a stupid stupid meta I want to see Barnabus facing down Galvatron or whatever his name is  but whens that going to happen unless I literally play both sides\", \"commentId\": \"35690\", \"commentDate\": \"1492683914\"}, {\"comment\": \"I agree  Its a terrible quest  When you see the Shamans get a hand filled with Murlocs and Hunters got this PoS quest  you realise just how much the designers have an ongoing lovefest for overpowered shaman cards and aggro decks  It would have

hisher ideas end up in an actual game  Almost every time I look at the expansion and I think oh wow  finally something cool Itll be fun again and then    theres this tiny  little card that screws us all right up   What would the meta be without quest rogues More mages Maybe  but would it be so bad We have like Eater of Secrets  right So that would be more used and wed be fine I think  Thats possible to counter  How to counter quest rogue Just be faster pirate warrior smiles with a stupid smile  I feel like quest for rogue should require playing not 4 but 6 minions  Why Mage requires 6 spells and reward is shit  lets face it  Its good for some combo stuff  but in general    meh  Quest for rogue gives you value right when you play it and its much  much easier to complete\",
