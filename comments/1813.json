this game was just purely stupid for me  Faced a dragon priest in standard  As always tried to make the better plays  tried to preserve my removals as much as I can Like I knew he was going to play his dragon OP on t5  when there were Northshire Cleric  Mana Geode and a Curious Glimmerroot on his side of the board  I didnt play anything  nor have I summoned a totem for he to gain value out of them  All combined were 15 health  who can die perfectly in a Volcano  And they did  But the BS started after he played Elise and used Shadow Visions for the pack  Or with the 3 Dr  OPs  where he always got my hex  How to play around my minions being Devolved  one of which transformed into Acolyte of Pain  so it could be immediately potioned      some will say  there are worse situations  some will mention yogg  but i just hate games like this\", \"commentId\": \"38017\", \"commentDate\": \"1495740272\"}, {\"comment\": \"casual in a nutshell 60 top tier ladder decks 40 hunters who draw
