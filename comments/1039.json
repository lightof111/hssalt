 Switched to Dragon Priest as a counter and what do I meet  Bloody hunters   No worries there  switch to Lock and run into a league of Shammies   I felt like Id wondered into the Cenarion Circle summer camp   I have some fun with them then switched back to the only deck Ive managed to flatten Shammies with    only to get 5 warriors in a roll   I closed out on a malyrogue that burned me down in one turn after the annoying little arsehole hid his Emperor T with stealth  I didnt mind that so much as now Ive seen the deck type  I can play around it   My annoyances in my runs 1  With myself for making some DUMB fucking moves in a number of these games that could have led to victory2  Hunters spamming emotes in whatt  Some attempt to rattle the opposition  to big themselves up  I dunno   I generally dont get too bothered by facerollers but when they mass emote in some perceived show of dominance  Fucked me off royally3  With the preparation spell   Seriously   4  Having Chromaggus
