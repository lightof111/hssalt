arent 5050 Many spells like Swipe specifically target the opponent  whilst some specifically target you summoning effects  secrets  most notably Also  board clears are theoretically targetting

interactive card that only punishes people playing tempomidrangecontrol decks I was trying some grim decks earlier  I faced a Druid and thought well its a good matchup  no worry  I got a pretty good start and was clearly ahead  He topdecked well his removals but i managed to comeback and to be ahead again  close to lethal  Until he drops Yogg and singlehandedly won the game  Got tilted after that unlucky games before that werent helpingand made some tilt misplays during the two games that followed  Worst thing about YoggThe larger majority of the community adores the card and think its fun Since when is it fun to play an overpowered card based on pure randomnessAt least Secret Garbagedin was predictable and slightly more interactive\", \"commentId\": \"24158\", \"commentDate\":
