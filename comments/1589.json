{\"comment\": \"Okay Hearthstone  whats your problem  I was playing against a mage whom picked a 1 Mana Kazakus potion and it brought back a doomsayer on their turn  A couple actions later and theyve now got an Alarmobot on their side of the field with the doomsayer  On my turn I wasnt going to be able to remove the doomsayer so I went face thinking everything would die like it was supposed to  Had I known what was about to happen was going to work this way I would have removed the stupid alarmobot  On their turn Doomsayer triggers like normal and it triggers first  Everythings supposed to die right WRONG Alarmobots effect triggers swapping it with a minion from their hand and the doomsayer finishes resolving  Instead of everything dying the minion brought in gets to remain on the field What the heck Doomsayer triggered first which means that everything should have been destroyed  including the alarmobot before it triggered since doomsayer resolves first  Or if it pulls something in then doomsayer finishes resolving than what was pulled in shouldnt have been left behind  Blizzard fix your priorities  The same thing happens with Sylvanas deathrattle occasionally where the order in which something is supposed to resolve doesnt quite work out the way its supposed to  If something should die before the effect triggers then it should die without resolving its effect  Please give a priority order for these cards because otherwise when theyre overlapped like this what should happen  doesnt  Pretty sure my opponent wasnt expecting it to work this way either since I could see them frantically mousing over their card that lived and then back to hand a couple times  or maybe they did who knows Now I know for next time and Ill play around it  Just sick of finding this stuff out

normal Deathwing from it  so I could craft my Ragnaros the Firelord after DEing the golden one  The only thing that was ever deterred me from playing the game is was the AllStar Squad Brawl  and the Mind Blast Priest and the Sinister Strike Rogue  and the Grimscale Oracle Warriors  But when I dont play the game  I always play another games  and they arent related to any card games\",

been played first  However  if the opposing Sylvanas was the one played first  her DR would have activated first  Since I assume  your board was empty  she wouldnt have stolen anything  but then your Sylvanas DR would activate and steal whatever other minion was on your opponents board  Now  rearding the whole salt thing  just to stay on topic  dont you love it when playing buffadin and upping
