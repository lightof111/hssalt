about this  But iksarHS interview takes the cake  Thats some quality bullshit excuses from him  design space this  identity that  promoting fun archetypes for 1 players  miracle is strong  no aoe  no heals  no taunts  no nerf reverts  Thats just infuriating coming from actual blizzard employee and not random internet moron  Also hes okay with hunter countering rogue as class  Not one deckarchetype countering another  And amazing Rogue will probably struggle  Were okay with that\", \"commentId\": \"28425\", \"commentDate\": \"1480246563\"}, {\"comment\": \"After i read hat interwiev i said okay

comes to Rogue  The thing is  in Beta  the Hero power was pretty good  It used to equip the dagger then add 1 attack to it every turn after that  I believe it also added 1 to whatever weapon you had equipped at the time  Thing is  that was too good  So they nerfed it  And the nerfs have kept coming  I feel for Rogue players  when I play against a Golden Rogue I have more respect for the player
