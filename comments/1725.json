though playing my version of controlele shamanbut at first i was in a win streak 4 stars and i needed only 1 win  next game was against QR    from needing 1 win I ended up needing 3 winsthen vs an aggro deck my deck beats the aggro ones  so this one was a win  then QR again and all of them got the reward on turn 4  5and ppl defend this deck  are you effin kidding menote  i know  that my deck is really a slow one and it fails to combo decks  but come on  finishing the quest and then prep  reward is just BS\", \"commentId\": \"36193\", \"commentDate\": \"1493328405\"}, {\"comment\": \"You know
