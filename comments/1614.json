paired with is Jade Druid     That to add insult to injury now seems to run Naturalize not only to kill my huge turn 4 minion but also to make mill a card   And icing on the cake the emote spam    I usually dont care about that I just hit Squelch and call it a day  but when youre playing one of the most brainless Decks ever that is built around one of the worst designed cards ever and youll most likely win not cause you outplayed me but just cause of the aforementioned card at least have the decency to keep your mouth shut    That being said Jade Druid guy I just played I hope you have a nice

card above 6 mana other than ancient of war so they almost always have a nice curve AND if theyre in topdeck mode theyre not really punished for having many cheap cards since those generate 77 golems  Aya is also just straight up broken  boring as a card pretty much only serves as a paywall to play jade decks  Something like dragon warrior or old gods midrange hunter had to include ragnaros  double cotw  grommash  deathwing so they could get screwed with a heavy hand  late game bad topdecks and cant fix curve with innervate  Jade just throws that whole concept out of the window  Brann  netherspite historian and drakonid operative also screw that concept hard  Why run late game when you can curve out like a pro AND discover your late game on the go\", \"commentId\": \"33890\",

he made it all the way to rank 4 with that deck though although the rest of his deck was just normal  I let the Noggenfogger live but mainly because that game was won anyways  so not even the biggest

in Wild if Im making a wild deck  Im not going to go soft on you just because you drop Noggenfogger on an empty board  He messes up where all attacks go and where all targeted spells go  Thats the risk you take when you play Noggenfogger in decks  Hes a priority target just like Sylvanas and Ragnaros  I dont want to play a game where everything is completely random  especially when Im testing a deck I intend to use later in actual ranked play  This is my personal preference and Im sure youll find some people who probably dont kill him right away  Both are acceptable  Im sorry you dont get
