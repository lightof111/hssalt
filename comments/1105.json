Hearthstone since closed Beta  but then I encounter a Nzoth  which rewards for playing your control game unifficiently  Yogg which nullifies everything which was done before it and just turns the game into a dice poker  Call of the Skill  with 11 mana worth of stats for 8 or another major bullshit Blizzard pulled in the latest expansion  and just concede and leave the game again  It is disgusting how they managed to mangle their own game for the sake of pure profits  Valve got some heat recently about hooking up children on disguised slotmachines in their loot crate openings  Well  I think Blizzard does exactly the same with Hearthstone  aiming at exactly the same buttons  trying to enable the gambling addiction in their players with all these uncontrollable flashy effects  Honestly  there were even threads on Reddit with Im addicted to Yogging titles  ecstatically describing how amazing it feels to play a big Yogg and watch the spells spin  not knowing how it will end and realizing the whole game depends on its outcome  So fucking sad\", \"commentId\": \"23073\", \"commentDate\": \"1469341976\"}, {\"comment\": \"i truly honestly fucking hate this game   whats a good

Cancer Worgen in rank 5   It was a weird NZoth control without Truesilver Champion but with Justicar Trueheart and I thought well  if I can combo before he draws Tirion  I guess its an easy win  But if he plays Tirion Im dead   So he was at 9 cards in his hand and pulled off a Acolyte of Pain  Well  I decided to punish that making he draw 3 cards from the Acolyte  Ok  first one burnt was Defender of Argus  that could make things really hard for me specially because would get me by surprise  Then I passed the turn and  in draw step  he burnt Tirion  Those were literally the only two cards in the whole deck that could make me lose  Ok  I won without even using Execute  such plays  gg he must have been really salty  I would get 3 victories and a row and a bonus star  I didnt  Damn Forgot that  Game punishes as well    I just want to share this story here\", \"commentId\": \"23077\", \"commentDate\": \"1469353410\"}, {\"comment\": \"Nice  probably should be in the pepper thread

opponent emotes and plays something that obviously gives him lethal  In the Combo druid days  Hmmm    well played meant I have combo  Personally  I dont mind this at all  I do mind if someone is saying hello 12 times in a row  Not because its perceived as bad manner  but simply because its boring to listen to nonstop  If someone emotes like this twice in a row  I squelch  Well played is totally fine though  winner or loser  People emoted I will crush you and my magic will tear you apart after they won a match against me and I did not mind at all  I mean  the emote is there to be used
