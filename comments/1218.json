number of moves and its neutered for generally half the cost  If the opponent can just throw out highmanes without doing anything else  then youve lost complete control of the board and are basically dead unless you have a lethal combo coming the next turn  CotW is diculous  nobody is ever gonna argue that  But CotW is also insanely predictable  Its like having a board filled with 4hp or less minions on turn 7 against a mage and getting surprised that the flamestrike wiped out everything you had   If your deck isnt designed to kill before turn 8 then your deck should have some good method of clearing that board and dealing with that stuff  If the deck isnt designed to be able to do either thing then it deserved to lose in the first place  By that point the hunter is gonna be topdecking for its life  so unless youre real low  clearing that CotW should put you pretty safely in the lead\", \"commentId\": \"25553\", \"commentDate\": \"1473292582\"}, {\"comment\": \"Whats an anti hunter
