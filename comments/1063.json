saying  yes its a bit unbalanced but if you cant get past rank 18 youre either really really really bad  you play for like 2 Hours a month or your Reno list is literally crap  Im not trying to bash you  the meta is annoying  but being rank 18 has nothing to do with that  I hit rank 14 literally 1 Hour after this Months reset starting from rank 18  And i play Miracle or NZoth Rogue  which are really bad in the current Meta  Not priest level  but not really tier 1 \", \"commentId\": \"22189\", \"commentDate\": \"1467372502\"}, {\"comment\": \"Come on yogg give one change to beat tempo mages

dont play rogue  If you playing tempo mage  I want you to die  with that many random cards its not Jaina  its fckng Millhouse  are u fckng kidding me Play freeze or dont play mage  it dishonors my favorite class  If you playing dragon or pirate warrior actually  dragon and pirate anything  i really hope you gonna die  play control or patron  or dont touch warrior you idiots  Im so sick of it  omg  so many idiots who bullying my classis with idiotic decks  wtf  Just the same with Reno or CThun decks  Druid  ramp  token  unfortunatly you lost ForceSavage  but it would be canonical as well Hunter  face  midrange  wtf is that yogg bullshit Mage  its FREEZE  not tempo  pls stop it or at least throw away from the deck missiles  flamewaker  faceless summoner and of course yogg Paladin  anything but murloc paladin  r u kidding me Can you imagine Uther commanding Murlocs  what Priest  controlfatigue style decks  wtf is that dragon insanity Rogue  Miracle style decks  Oil was pretty nice but sadly it was nerfed  pls no deathrattles  use some other class for it Shaman  i guess there is nothing to much uncanonical Warlock  zoo and handlock both feel pretty canonical  unless its Reno  but I guess its the only way to play handlock right now without moltens Warriors  control and patron  thats all\", \"commentId\": \"22200\", \"commentDate\": \"1467389642\"}]"
