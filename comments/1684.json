a nerf  Ill spend my time playing Shadowverse instead of being cannon fodder for broken netdecks  Jesus Christ this game just gets worse and less playable and more dependent on playing broken netdecks every sesason  It beggars belief that anyone gets any pleasure out of playing it and that a fucking moron like Brode gets any airtime  NEVER PAY REAL MONEY FOR HEARTHSTONE PACKS  you will regret it\",
