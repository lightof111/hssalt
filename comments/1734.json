"[{\"comment\": \"People who still complain about pirate warrior are pathetic  YOU HAVE COUNTERS FOR IT STB got nerfed  we got Golakka Crawler  we got Ooze that gives you armor  you have taunt  you have heal  you have AoEs and you still fucking complain At least you have a chance to win a game somehow  Well guess what  there is NO counter for Quest Rogue  and dont get me startin with that Dirty Rat bullshit  Pirate warrior did not permanently kill deck archtypes  Its disgusting how that card still exists And you wanna know the reason people are playing Pirate Warrior Because its the only way you can beat Quest Rogue hyper aggro decks Yeah nice game indeed  There is no scenario in which any form of control deck beats Quest Rogue  its a design space destroyer Hell  not even Elemental Shaman has ANY chance of beating it even though its midrange deck\", \"commentId\": \"36367\", \"commentDate\": \"1493654390\"}, {\"comment\": \"All I face are shitty pirate warriors again  I know its the

against Quest Reno NZoth Priest  My opponent plays a random Piloted Sky Golem in his deck that I destroy and it summons the best minion possible a Dreadsteed  My opponent then gets to complete his quest simply by trading his Dreadsteed multiple times and summoning it back as they count for the Priest quest summon Deathrattle minions  My opponent then proceeds to Mirage Caller the Dreadsteed adding a 2nd unkillable 11 to his board that serve as walls against my Ragnaros hero power  I still think I might be able to win if I get some lucky shots at his face but then he plays NZoth which ends up summoning 4 additional Dreadsteeds that completely soak the damage from my hero power and invalidate my win condition  Opponent BMs left and right and ropes the following turns while slowly trading his Dreadsteeds against my minions and finally killing me  As the defeat screen appeared I noticed a notification a recent opponent would like to be your friend  I didnt stick around to read his words of wisdom\", \"commentId\": \"36372\", \"commentDate\": \"1493663135\"}, {\"comment\": \"hahahaha so after 4 pirate warriors and 6 murloc palladins  in a row  i decide tech for them  Guess

{\"comment\": \"Ive never been salty about anything of Hearthstone in the 2 years Ive played it  I respected Patron warrior and freeze mage players skill   I enjoyed playing the control game against face hunter  pirate warrior and secret paladin  But in the past few weeks  its as if I was forced to choose between playing decks that bore me out of my mind  or degenerating into a pile of salt  Every time I come up with an interesting  creative concept for a deck  I end up deciding against playing it because its an auto loss against quest rogue andor quest warrior   Ive been trying to be a good sport and played all my games through even when the matchup is abysmal but it feels terrible   Just starting a game these days feels terrible Im on the verge of quitting  The sad thing is that I still have great desire to play Hearthstone but the Hearthstone I love and desire to play doesnt exist anymore   All I want is to play some control games and not be punished before the game even starts for queuing into something that hard counters me Come on blizzard  just because you ruined WoW with your bad expansions doesnt mean you need to do it to its TCG spin off too   We dont even get the option of a Nostalrius HS server  I would pay good money to play HS with the last few expansions deleted but we all know thats not happening Yesterday I was so damn salty that I went on vS  looked for the worst matchup of quest rogue and crafted myself the best aggro druid deck I could find   While playing that on ladder  I was thinking  Pirate warrior keeps quest rogue in check  I feel kind of bad for beating him up and This guy plays priest  I need to utterly destroy him so that he gtfo ladder and stops feeding the rogues   Control priest is my all time favorite deck to play  mind you This morning I was feeling better so I made myself a questless control warrior that won the first 7 games  On the 8th game  I found a quest warrior which led to 15mins of salt and pain  Thats what I get for trying to have fun and play real control decks in 2017\", \"commentId\": \"36375\", \"commentDate\": \"1493671260\"}, {\"comment\": \"Try Control Shaman\", \"commentId\": \"36376\",

seriously  when I added some of my opponents and questioned why they emoted  clearly they didnt give their reason  Only one fucking person actually apologized  Like cmon  I was hoping that the
