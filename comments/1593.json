\"commentDate\": \"1489183262\"}, {\"comment\": \"Yes you dont understand the logic  Anyone who argues rigged matchmaking is impossible because of symmetry  someone else is getting favoured so it wouldnt work  really doesnt think very well  Lets say you have one overpowered card or deck on ladder just increase the chances of it getting a less favoured matchup  now you dont have to worry about balance  it will still win a bit more but it wont look quite so bad statistically  Lets say you want people to buy packs to boost your income stream  just increase the chances of a bad matchup for the old decks a little and now the new decks will be riding higher in the meta and people will spend money because they want to win  Lets say there are 4 balanced new meta decks on the ladder but one of the old decks shits all over 3 of them  Increase the chances the old deck matches up with the meta one it doesnt have a favoured match against  so its win rate is now lowered  Make sure you dont apply the rigged matchmaking every single game  just on some  randomise it so its harder to detect  It would be quite easy to rig the matchmaking to suit business purposes  no tinfoil hat is required  Blizzard have 10s if not hundreds of millions of dollars of income stream from Hearthstone and I think the matchmaking is dodgy as fuck  rigged  Edit  I think I understand what you are saying though  the matchmaking certainly doesnt always match every deck with its hard counter  but I think it does sometimes select a harder match or a mirror or similar for some decks to suit Blizzards current needs to push play in a certain direction  Think of a card or deck you havent seen in weeks on ladder  put together a deck using that card  youll come across it shortly  Ive been messing around with Cthun  Paladin decks today  13 of my matchups have been cthun especially Cthun priest and even Cthun warrior  It just feels rigged as fuck\", \"commentId\": \"33462\", \"commentDate\":

territory for me  and I play Wild for fun  not for the PirateJade grind  so if Wild rank 1510 is the same as Standard  Im going to steer clear from that I already made it past 10 on Standard this season  So all in all  I actually disagree I dont believe the game is fun at every rank  But to each his own I guess\", \"commentId\": \"33463\", \"commentDate\": \"1489187891\"}, {\"comment\": \"100
