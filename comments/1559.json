keep getting this feeling over and over again  I am a player since day 1 of Hearthstone and I remember how fun it was back in Vanilla and GvG  I mean really really fun  No matter if winning or losing it wouldnt have made much difference  But 9095 of the decks that I come across now are 100 copy list tryhard decks  As long as theyre in Ranked I shouldnt mind  right The problem is they are in Casual  Aggro Shamans  Pirate Warriors and Mages  You cant play some fun  interesting decks cause you always face the same decks  Thats what I hate about Hearthstone  Tryharding even in Casual  cause fuck other people right\", \"commentId\": \"32728\", \"commentDate\": \"1487884485\"}, {\"comment\": \"That sacrificial pact tech though lol  But yeah  youre right\", \"commentId\": \"32729\",

fixed  I do playtest in Casual sometimes and dont mind hitting ladder decks when Im doing that  but otherwise if youre just in there to try out something weird or fun  its horrible\", \"commentId\":

should remain the standard  This adjustment alone would fix a lot in my opinion   2 different kind of casuals one that rewards you something will still reward people something  That form of casual would see even more T1 decks than ladder \", \"commentId\": \"32731\", \"commentDate\": \"1487886016\"}, {\"comment\": \"The same reason they get away with playing Turn 3 Brann when I have multiple
