at 26 hp  The only effective thing he did was playing an Emperor  therefore I knew its the combo deck  Its okay  I had Tirion  Lightlord  Ivory Knight on board  close to lethal  double full board clear in hand in case things go south  what could go wrong Exactly  Yogg can go wrong  It filled his board  and that wasnt even the problem  it casted DOOM after  Guy drew 1011 cards  basically his entire remaining deck  Then next turn he proceeded to play Malygos into double Living Roots and double Moonfire  almost all drawn from DOOM  1 discounted Living Roots was enough for him  to win the game  This is my luck  When I think there is no lower  there always is\", \"commentId\": \"25845\", \"commentDate\": \"1473770955\"}, {\"comment\": \"The main problem with Hearthstone these days  Most
