made it to rank 5 even hit rank 2  5 stars last season using purely homebrews  I used some weird silence buff priest last season and a burgle rogue and luckydo weaponbuff pirate rogue this season  Its definitely possible and feels great when it works out  I would agree though that the ranked floors dont do much for helping someone hit rank 5  Its more for keeping the high ranks out of rank 20

golden  But I dont want to play Jade  Its fucking boring and revolves around Idol  Not to mention I know when I queue up a mirror match  its going to be Jade fucking Druid  I love Paladin  Another golden  But its shit right now   I love Rogue  Yep  got a golden  But Im so worn out on Auctioneer and the same fucking gimmicks that I dont want to bother  Yet again  I know even if I did I would just queue up another Miracle Rogue  Oh boy  mirror matches are fun fun fun  Same thing with Shaman  I got to golden using a straight up totem Shaman  No Trogg  no fucking Jade  no 77  That was fun  But now I would get torched  No point  And I have already documented my Pirate Warrior experience  What a cunty  vomitinducing deck that is  I mean you guys who are bitching from losing to it  try playing it too  Youll hate it even more and thats whether you win or lose  Maybe thats why Ill never get to legend  I just dont find these top tier decks to be fun so Its hard for me to stick with them  I dont feel a sense of winning or accomplishment from having to use a fucking netdeck to ladder up  Its not that I cant make my own  I just know my own wont beat a Jade Druid or Jade Shaman

 Criticizes pirate Warrior   Which the idea of these decks are to burn down Jade decks  and Reno decks as fast as they can because they cant play the value game   Plays tempo mage   Seems legit\",

sometimes that is not the optimal strategy against certain decks because they simply outvalue him  However  versus other decks he can play more of a value game  The guy is just playing midrange deck properly based on the current matchup and you sound like you dont understand the game and think the only way to play is super greedy\", \"commentId\": \"32978\", \"commentDate\": \"1488400367\"},

aggro decks have a place   I may not always love playing against them  but I know they have a place in the game   Hotform is an avid whiner every time he plays against an aggro deck   Hotform specifically said that his tempo mage deck cant outvalue a jade or reno deck  and he has to burn it down as fast as possible He is nothing more than a hypocrite   Because he whines and cries about every aggro deck he plays against  yet  the point is a pirate warrior and an aggro shaman have to burn down a jade and reno deck fast like his tempo mage deck because they cant outvalue those types of decks in the late game   He is a major hypocrite    You call tempomage a mid range deck there are many others here who would disagree with you   They claim its an aggro deck   He actually had someone dead on turn 4  so its easy to see why some would say it is an aggro deck   Im not saying either way  personally   Because the point is  he is using a deck that has the same purpose as the very decks he whines and cries about    So much so  he made a full 9 minute whining about an aggro Shaman who happened to draw almost the nuts   Im sure someone could take the clip from his game where he killed a Renolock by turn 4 and make the same kind of video he did   Hes a whiny hypocrite  thats all the point of my post was\", \"commentId\": \"32982\", \"commentDate\": \"1488406281\"}, {\"comment\":
