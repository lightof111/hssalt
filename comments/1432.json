life  youre dead  Thats what balances Jaraxxus  Can you afford to spend one turn doing basically nothing to set up a long value game with jaraxxus Thats cool   But Alex always sucks unless you have enough life to burst the opponent down in 2 turns  Only Mage can do this with Ice Block  Warrior used to with Grommash  Deaths Bite It makes the card so wasted because you can only ever use one mode on it  If it set a player to 20 instead  then it would be a lot better for healing and a lot worse for bursting  so it might balance it  i e  make no one play it ever again lol \", \"commentId\":
