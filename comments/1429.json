is true that this thread is for salty posts but people only respect your arguments as long as they are valid even if they are solely based on your saltiness  If you complain about a type of a common deck or an entire class  which you think is broken  then at least do not mention that you are playing Renolock since as I had mentioned previously  many people find it so hard and cancer to deal with

one of the only remaining decks that need thinking cancer  because it finally stands a chance against the actual cancer decks  And this line You only get attention if you are not playing one of those

renolock is complaining on a shaman that is a fairly difficult match for them but not as tough as jade or OTK  because can never draw the thing that punishes them although they blatantly avoid to play around it  Thats it  no more  no less  And yes  thats a motive to post salt  Damn  even if you were pirate warrior vs somewhat hard deck  youd had the right of complaining if you drew crap there will always be one or more that says you deserved it  but still you are allowed to complain  From Someone who got bullied in this forum for playing face hunter Naxx face hunter  no Huntertaker at all and

its best  period and jade druids do not crash renolock  if you just sit there and try to remove the minions  of course you are going to loose  If only druid draws perfectly on curve and renolock draws absolutely trash  then druid will have chance to win since he will have the necessary time to build the army\", \"commentId\": \"29968\", \"commentDate\": \"1482421125\"}, {\"comment\": \"Renolock
