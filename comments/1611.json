without adjusting the deck to their playstyle  Thats what I would call copypasting  But its absolutely fine to go for the same deck concepts if its proven that they work in the current meta  Also  this game is supposed to be played on curve in order to be played efficiently  That is basic knowledge\", \"commentId\": \"33828\", \"commentDate\": \"1489875060\"}, {\"comment\": \"Elaborate   Ive played buffadin for months  never gotten farther than rank 10 Before that i played Curator druid   never got further than rank 10  The moment i try the only tier 2 deck i can make  jade shammy  theres

hit rank 1210 most seasons without riding the cancerwagon  I dont know what a Bufadin is and I dont know what curator Druid is    because I dont netdeck  Im not toning down the cancer stuff  If you are playing a netdeck Shaman because if you cant beat em join em prepare to get BM and disrespect from people who dont respect that OP shit  If you get to rank 10 without resorting to netdecks like Jade Shaman  or Renolock or Dragon Priest then that is an achievement  I take my hat off to you  If you improve to rank 5 because    Shaman  did you improve  or just copy a cancer decklist\",

stand this anymore    After 3k of victories in that crappy unbalanced clownfiesta mode  I made the decision to not touch that mode never ever again   Ranked mode is a joke too  full of pathetics

wild cancer decks   Like Secret fuckhead Paladin  Pirate warriors with two different cards than the standard version  Plenty of dooshbag Shamans  and of course a few scattered goofy decks that always seem to draw perfectly   Its getting to be impossible to find any fun in this game anymore   For every decent game you play you have to endure 20 awful ones where you just face netdeck after netdeck     There are WAY too many OP decks right now   Pirate Warrior is fucking insane   By turn 2 they have a full board and a buffed weapon   What the FUCK are you supposed to do  Play some boooooooring Reno deck and hope you draw him by turn 6  Right   Good luck   Fuck that   Shamans are still loaded with incredible cards at every mana level and overload doesnt slow them down at all   Not at fucking all   Then you get to deal with KazakusRenoFreeze Mage decks that are beyond irritating   Its more fun shoving your balls into a wood chipper   Dont forget the occasional FinjaAnyfuck Paladin  loads of enjoyment there too  This is why Im done spending actual money on the game  Ill do dailies and goof around but thats it   Its simply NOT fun anymore\", \"commentId\": \"33838\", \"commentDate\":

ulderman mid range  into truesilvers  consecration  sylvanas  both versions of ragnoras and Tirion  Have not run into a single person running that list  Pretty much dead to Jade Druid and Reno anything though  Last season hit 12 with 3 decks an extremely aggressive charge zoo running 2 argent commander  2 argent horse rider  reckless rocketeers and 1 doomguard an all demon deck with bloodfury  and the bad demons like felguard and succubus a very greedy control priest with mind control  cabal and talon priest  but no thoughtsteal and no dragons other than azure drake  Ive also experimented with nzoth hunters  paladins with extreme heal  and ramp Druid with faceless shamblers  Im probably not quite as unbalanced as I appear  I just lose so much to the same decks over and
