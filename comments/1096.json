"[{\"comment\": \"This game needs to slow the fuck down  Every season it gets faster and faster  and the devs arent doing anything real to fix it  They nerfed the fuck out of combo druid  but that was one of the only playable decks that had to survive to turn 9 to win  There are so many cool things in the game that are just garbage because of broken early game cards  Midrange pally is one of my favorite decks ever  and its really good  but it just needs more than one turn to set up  If I go second against this aggro shit  I have no chance  even though I can flood the board fairly easily   Putting a bunch of crazy 10 mana cards wasnt enough blizzard needs to nerf the crazy one drops like abusive sergeant and tunnel trogg\", \"commentId\": \"22872\", \"commentDate\": \"1468877596\"},

tempo mage  i had cthun out with 21 attack  surprisingly he didnt have polymorph for it  So thought I might have a chance  Earlier he had played a cabalists tome and didnt fireball once that game so i

free 55  Itll end being an evolve shaman  wich happens to be the most gimmick of all those nasty shamans  Bbut lets hope we geet some nice aggro counters before that\", \"commentId\": \"22890\",
