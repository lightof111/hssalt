I have seen any other class besides paladin  mage  or rogue in the last month in arena  The part of the game I enjoy the most about the game is honestly collecting all the cards  but its counter productive when I cant even play half of these  It would be nice if Blizzard made a ban list for Play mode no shredder  no flamewaker  no slyvannas or some kind of restriction  It would be cool if that were in play plus a dust cost restriction so people who want to play fun decks can actually enjoy themselves and see other decks and enjoy incredible moments of Hearthstone    not facing against netdecks over and over again  Even playing netdecks themselves gets boring after a while  I just wish blizzard had a safe space for these crazy fun cards  so they get the spotlight they deserve  I only get on hearthstone for the quests now adays  its not as enjoyable as it used to be               but srsly FK YOU TO THE GUY WHO TOP DECKED THE ENTIRE GAME      FK YO SAGGY WALRUS TITS MUTHAFUCKA

be the end of my playing days     Theres nothing in the adventure that will help control  There are a few cards that will give Rogue and Druid a great shot at joining the aggro party  Its awful right

would imply  as they still continue to play it for the simple fact that some aspect of it is enjoyable for them  Even if that aspect is the masochistic pleasure derived from continuously torturing oneself   I read this thread regularly but typically have little reason to post here  and yeah  some of the stuff I see is absolutely appalling  but who hasnt had that moment of controller tossing frustration induced from a video game  Having been there a time or two  I understand the frustration  but what continues to confuse me is why people come here and attempt to be a voice of reason   For

mode is the only place to learn a deck that doesnt involve the possibility of deranking  Blizzard should absolutely address this which of course means they probably wont  There should be a mode called practice or something of that ilk for the purpose of getting acclimated to a ladder deck  With that said thered still be nothing to prevent discourteous players from playing established decks on casual so Im not sure that alone solves the problem   Blizzard could add more restrictive game modes which would offer their own unique meta and that would be awesome  You could do tiers by dust count  restrictions on card text no charge  no deathrattle  etc  only minions mode  etc  These kinds of things would make the game fresh again  and I really hope Blizzard eventually comes to this realization   Most importantly I think Blizzard should add a submode for new players that only grants access if youre under a combined total character level and dust value of your collection  That way players would have a safer place to learn the game that didnt involve playing the cpu over and over again  or getting wrecked by veterans\", \"commentId\": \"24279\", \"commentDate\": \"1471423861\"},
