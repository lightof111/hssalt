bullshit that matches you against opponents that have an advantage versus the deck you picked every single time you press play  Or the nutty draws that people have  Every time I play against a hunter

being close to legend  and never having gotten legend before due to all the shitty L2001000 gatekeepers I wouldnt be this bothered with Hearthstone and what I face  Id rather be sitting here enjoying Gwent where theres no concept of face  no aggro decks  no limit on rewards  every match you get 10 of a pack keg  and actual thinkingstrategy involved  No  instead Im sitting here like an idiot
