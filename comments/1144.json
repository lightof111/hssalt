"[{\"comment\": \"Guys please  this is ridiculous  There are multiple viable decks  and even a tier 3 priest can climb if you play allot and smart  What do you consider a test of how good you are at hearthstone Playing an inefficient deck that cant counter anything in the meta Thats not skill  Yes there are autopilot decks but there is nothing thats unbeatable as long as you have a somewhat consistent deck   Theres no deck right now that is like Undertaker  or old Patron  Just pick a deck you enjoy  as long as its viable  and play it  I really appreciate both of you guys for your daily contributions to this thread  but this is just stupid\", \"commentId\": \"23909\", \"commentDate\": \"1470828685\"}, {\"comment\": \"Yes  there is no right deck now and there hasnt been one in a long time  You can climb with anything  I was just referring to a time long ago when there actually were right decks and it did seem like the game had forced you to play them\", \"commentId\": \"23910\",

leaving my opponent at 1hp and cant kill even tho theres like 7 cards out the 10 remaining that can kill him  in 2 turns Ill get nothing and he top decks fireball to finish me    At least if my opponent was playing well  but when I see retards in casual playing netdecks and getting super lucky  im frustrated but I keep playing because eventually Ill get a good hand and have fun  RNG cards are just bad imo yogg being the worst  yeah give my opponent Noble Sacrifice and Freezing Trap just the turn before I kill him  Sometimes I lose 45 games in a row just because I have a bad mulligan or never draw what I need in time  Ive never been lucky with card games since Ive started playing MTG in 1997  ask my friends how Ive lost tournaments like that\", \"commentId\": \"23911\",

5050s and get legend  reaching a higher rank between 2030  mostly playing my take on the token druid theme without yogg or freeze mage  I hoped  maybe  just MAYBE the highlegend part of RNGstone plays a little different decks How naive I was  its literally a face shaman and dragon warrior fiesta  Not even midrange  otk or control  no Zero priests LUL  zero mages  zero rogues  zero paladins  not even warlocks  12 hunter and some yogg druids  And I played over 60 games today  This is so sad and pathetic  that even the top 100 people keep playing cancer nonstop  Whats the point I understand the reason of playing the best decks for highest winrates  but its still so early in the season  Even if you somehow reach top 10 legend  you will just fall back so much through the rest of the season

playing none of them   The decks I have enjoyed are inconsistent at best because ladder right now is just Arena on steroids   Im going to give dragon priest a second shot    what i meant was  you can outplay your opponent on every turn and lose simply because they have better draws or a higher tier deck   in fact  i will go so far as to say they are absolutely favored if they have a better deck and better draws  regardless of how well you play   and im not saying i want to hit legend with a tier 4 deck   i just want to hit rank 5 with a viable deck that I enjoy that isnt midrange shaman

stabilize on the board after him only going face  destroy his doomhammer  he still has the burst left over to finish me off only hitting face the entire time  no trades and has hunter hero power from Sir Finley  The only thought from a Face Shaman is I need to hit face more Im annoyed because the deck is completely dependent on the the opponents hand not being insane  otherwise its completely autopilot or autolose for the Shaman  At least with midrange Shaman I know I usually got outtraded  he fights for board  and outvalues me in the end  this I can accept  same with Dragon Warrior  Its only these games I wish I was Cthun Warrior against them  just to watch fail against 20 armor heals  and massive taunts  Might have to switch back to Reno Rogue  and just build everything to destroy
