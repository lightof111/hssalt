on turn 10 Lol what foolishness  thats actually 0 21 burst damage for 5 mana  yeah thats totally fine  Also watched the latest Kripp video on MCTech lol  The stupidest card in the game  Well time to take a break until next expansion  RenoDragon priest was the only fun deck to come out in a while but its power level is just too weak and the draws too awkward to compete against all the automatic jade  pirate decks  I do see a decent amount of Reno Mage at least  those are fun game  But the rest are mostly just dumb  Shaman have way too many overly ridiculous cards  Jade Idol is a shit idea  Miracle Rogue is still far too viable  RenoLock would be fine if not for the dumbass burst and pirate decks are obviously just stupidly broken and will 100 get a nerf  but way too far down the line  because this game is curated by morons Oh well\", \"commentId\": \"30576\", \"commentDate\": \"1483686324\"}, {\"comment\": \"Pepper thread must be filled with people that played against SchruteBucks

compared to other Reno like Renolock which you know almost all 30 cards you will see   Ice Block if you can draw it is handy vs the Warlock insane burst    Ill be very glad once Emperor is gone  almost entirely because of the Leeroy  Power Overwhelming  Faceless Combo   Playing vs Warlock feels just like playing against Druid back when they had Combo   When playing vs Druid  you were in Danger once you hit around 15 HP  now Warlock tops that and has you in Danger the moment you reach 20 HP\", \"commentId\": \"30578\", \"commentDate\": \"1483698087\"}, {\"comment\": \"reno decks are

fixed yet  I honestly expected it to be THE nerfed card for patron warrior  Its not remotely fun or interactive how easily that card is able to gain attack  ad that for a 3drop with 4 health  Ive lost so many games because Im unable to deal with a 4health minion which is run in aggressive decks  and I just have to watch it grow past 10atttack  And you cant AoE for 3 or less damage on the board either because then you will just lose by how insane it becomes   Just make Frothing so it can only get a maximum of say 6 attack  Something like that  A lot of cards get nerfed by Blizzard because they arent fun or interactive yet this card is still a thing  Im not even asking for the Warsong treatment  where it becomes unplayable\", \"commentId\": \"30580\", \"commentDate\": \"1483698571\"}, {\"comment\": \"And why exactly hasnt Tunnel Trogg gotten the Mana Wyrm treatment yet I can guarantee you if it got changed to gain 1 attack whenever you overload it would still see play  100 sure  It would still be an insanely strong card  just not that broken  The whole idea behind Tunnel Trogg is dumb to begin with  Yes  lets give shaman the overload mechanic  so they have a drawback for playing insane cards on curve  such as Totem Golem and Flamewreathed Faceless  To follow that up  lets make a card that benefits from that drawback so it isnt a drawback anymore  Logic\", \"commentId\":

be able to deal with Pirate warrior where things have 2 or two heath  but they cant deal so well with 3 or 4 or more health minions  which can swamp the board  My Renolock even struggles  let alone if you live to turn 6 these days\", \"commentId\": \"30588\", \"commentDate\": \"1483707804\"}, {\"comment\": \"Ive reached a point where I just concede against Dragon Priest  not because its impossible  but because of Drakonid Operative  That card is just no fun at all  Its almost insulting to have your opponent look through your deck  take their turn picking a card Or 2 with Brann  say Thank you  and then reveal next turn they got a tauntlegendary andor removal  But its always something they can use against me  It gets way out of hand with Brann and Netherspite Historian  which  in most cases seem to give Operative as an option  I played Dragon Priest for awhile  and at first it was fun but eventually playing Drakonid Operative felt like cheating  No fun at all  I turn the game around because I picked a Rag or Fireball from my opponents deck  Good job  that takes so much skill  I just stopped playing that deck over time  I didnt want to win or play that way\", \"commentId\":

days ago I went on one of the biggest win streaks of my life from rank 15 to rank 11 with no losses  It was very exciting and I was so proud of myself   Well yesterday  I lost all the way down to rank 16  I wasnt tilted  I was very rarely misplaying  I guess what it might be is Im missing Patches in my aggro shaman and aggro warrior  I dont play exclusively those  I play a semibudget Renolock and Jade Druid  I dont have 1600 dust for a free 11 charge  This was the month I was going to try to hit Legend and I was off to a great start  Ive peaked at rank 5 and can get there again but man  this meta is brutal  So close to giving up  Really wish there was a safety net every 5 ranks  wouldve helped a little\", \"commentId\": \"30592\", \"commentDate\": \"1483717967\"}]"
