\"Erg I hate Nzoth I dont understand why theyd design this card  Its like CThun  but you dont even have to play any specific cards  Its just the best lategame card  for free and its wrecking wild and will always do so Theres no answer to a NZoth  If they have it  they win  Thats all it comes down to  Live to turn 10  draw it  play  win  Stupid There shouldnt be a card that grants 6 cards of tempo and card advantage  Its like a ysera that draws and plays 5 dreams of your choice right away Just dumb  NZoth is so bad for the game going forward  Why would you ever play any other kind of deck\",

would then be happy to rinse off all this saltiness from myself and just know that they drowned ingesting the saltiest of waters  which hopefully was one of the most excruciating of deaths imaginable

have better luck to top deck  these are baits so you can spend more money  game never let you win after certain point  so you buy more packs to have more cards to try alternative decks  since your winning streaks are low  you cant get enough in game gold so you pay  Oh and there are fucking son of a whores  their whore mothers fuck for a penny so they can play games  I really hate fucking top

{\"comment\": \"Dude  what are the developers of this game doing How can they justify their earnings In every fucking game if you release something thats overpowered you have to nerf that shit or people stop playing  Hearthstone is the only game where the devs dont play their game  I wanna sit with one at a table and hear the reason for not doing anything about it  How can you lose a game by turn 5 or even 4 How can you call this game competitive  Change the rank system  change heroes life points to 40 or 50  stop encouraging people to play aggro decks that if they draw decent you dont stand a chance  You need to draw like a god basically  I dont mind those people  but the devs of this game disgust me  A few months or years ago there was a poll if you either enjoy playing this game or watching a stream and the majority voted for watching a stream  How can that not scare you as a dev Im 100 that the poll is still relevant to date and the ones who enjoy playing this game are the ones with pirate decks  If you have to make a type of minion relevant by introducing aggro cards because you cant think of something more competitive you seem mediocre honestly  All im seeing are people trying to rush me down  Even if they have control decks or midrange  Thats one of the saddest things out there   The only reason I still play this game is for getting legend for the first time  if thats still an achievement  Therere so many things to say but I feel that the community of this game are complaining to a wall  Nobody gives a fuck about you and your stupid whiny posts\",
