immediately pass the turn  I cant tell you how often I would absentmindedly do this while Patches the Pirate would be shot out of a cannon and make me feel like a fool  This is an aggressive deck  but it doesnt mean you have to play every card at lightning speed Another card that tripped me up in the beginning was Bloodsail Cultist  For some reason I thought it buffed a weapon if you had a weapon equipped  unfortunately for me it requires that you have a Pirate on the board  Also  remember that Sir Finley Mrrgglton is not a Pirate and is a Murloc Hopefully these couples of tips will save you

different amounts would people netdeck as much The problem is that Patches costs exactly as much as say  Gruul  Kazakus costs exactly the same as like  Madam Goya  why would people spend dust on meme legendaries when they can get the good ones  dont get me wrong  its good that Luckstone isnt as hard to get into as Magic The CashingIn  but the fact that all legendaries are equal in cost is something that Ive realised contributes to the netdecking problem  People brew and innovate in magic often because they cant afford the cards or refuse to pay exorbitant amounts  so they come up with alternatives  but if I can spend 1600 dust on patches and have a playable deck  rather than have to spend 1600 on kazakus and then spend more dust for the other cards  I know what Im gonna play  especially if Im new or free to play  Food for thought  And obligatory if pirates are a problem patches isnt the cause because cuckaneer\", \"commentId\": \"31574\", \"commentDate\": \"1485583290\"},
