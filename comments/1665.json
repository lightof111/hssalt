"[{\"comment\": \"sorry bro  i cant play the decks i want because i keep getting matched up either with super greedy priest decks or fucking zoo or quest rogue   get it through your head people play aggro because at the beginning of the new expac everyone is experimenting with super greedy lists and if you actually want to climb you have to punish those or spend all day at the same rank   sorry not fun\", \"commentId\": \"34942\", \"commentDate\": \"1491709862\"}, {\"comment\": \"Blizzard pls stop all this stupid matchup   I beg you  I played elemental Shaman and all I face is Quest Rogue

quest completed by turn 5   The only thing this fucking patch did was replace aggro shaman with quest rogue  Which is arguably much worse  because nothing counters rogue once the quest is completed\",

have some brains  Each expansion they make the meta game more favorable for aggressive decks  Can t believe Pirate Warrior will still be around  At the higher ranks its either Warrior or Rogue you face  This is crap  Edit Also  you can t really tech against aggressive decks  because 1 it will make your deck weaker against other matchups and 2 you still depend on drawing your techs and will lose games if you don t draw them and even if you do draw them\", \"commentId\": \"34947\", \"commentDate\": \"1491725511\"}, {\"comment\": \"Im sorry  I know its early in the expansion  but I am sick of

an expansion with some clearly broken decks  sell as many packs as they can while the idiots ride the broken cancer decks up the ladder having fun basically by exploiting a cheat  Not realising their rank is meaningless  Lol probably as was last season when they played pirate or Renolock or Jade Shaman  I just imagine the multiple legends out there first time legend Huntertaker  Next legend Secret Paladin  Next rank 1 Aggro Shaman  Then Jade Shaman or Pirate Warrior  Meaningless  meaningless  meaningles    Meanwhile why cant people who actually want a balancedfair matchup get casual or wild modes without broken standard decks  AND seriously why the FUCK can we not have an autosquelch to silence the dumb fucks playing the cancer metadecks I mean I know you can squelch every match at the start but its easy to forget and get tilted when the bullshit emotes start  Autosquelch would be easy to code and wouldnt affect the emote spammers  not putting it in shows CONTEMPT of the player base  Hey Brode  heres my contempt  you suck at your job youve ruined Hearthstone and I will take EVERY opportunity to remind people that BEN BRODE NEEDS FIRING  and HEARTHSTONE IS A CON BASED AROUND

decent but instead its fucking somehow even more cancerous than what came before  Pirates still going strong  Druid is just unbeatable and quests are working in some weird way where my opponents without fail are finished by turn 5 or 3 in the case of every Rogue whereas if I try and use it I mulligan a hand of dead draws into another hand of dead draws  What the actual fuck\", \"commentId\":
