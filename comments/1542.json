EVERYONE runs the same exact fucking list   just how fucking low can netdecking go An entire archetype just changed with no exception not a single miracle after  based on 1 guy who did well with his own deck  The creativity is seriously fucking amazing  Now how about someone making a deck that actually require skill to pilot insted of going full face This is just ridiculous  I cant repeat enough  shame on all of you  You cant even play such simple deck  just highroll every shitty game and point your mouse to the face\", \"commentId\": \"32384\", \"commentDate\": \"1487262662\"}, {\"comment\":

horribly wrong  They are thirsty for winning the easiest way  and whatevers labeled with both face  easy to pilot and rank 1 legend  they will copy it I dont find it different  I find it unoriginal

similar to what a lot of people have been running  It will probably die down after a few days either way  Its not broken like Shaman is and I doubt anyone copying decklists can grind the way Muzzy does\", \"commentId\": \"32387\", \"commentDate\": \"1487264877\"}, {\"comment\": \"guys i just got totally fucking CRUSHED by aggro shaman at rank 2 casual   i hate this game   they need to stop

thankyou on the killing turn  thinking they are now great players   the game has become very monotonous and boring    you are forced to add a bunch of crap cards to avoid early aggro so all the decks looks almost the same   really bad meta   not having fun  I lose matches win some too then take the retarded deck shamman  pirate warrior even more dumb deck with auto throw every card that you draw on the face  climb again   get bored  change lose more than I win  repeat    Small Time Buccaneers shout followed by Im in charge now has my brain melted     And Im not saying this because I cant do it   I was rank 5 last season  now Im at rank 9  but its so boring  Needed to spit it out hehe GL all\", \"commentId\": \"32390\", \"commentDate\": \"1487267195\"}, {\"comment\": \"FUCK THIS FUCKING

miracle build  Its obviously worse than shaman in every way  If people only wanted to smorc to legend it is not he most efficient way to do so and I absolutely stand by the fact it was something different and thats  why so many people played it\", \"commentId\": \"32394\", \"commentDate\": \"1487274329\"}]"
