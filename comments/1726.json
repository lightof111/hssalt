and practically all I faced for dozens of games was hunter  murloc Pally  quest rogue  pirate warrior  taunt warrior  the very occasional Shaman or quest Mage or priest  Got sick of it and made a completely random warlock deck with jaraxus abyssal enforcer tar lurker lots of heal  first matchup was a slow Kafukus warlock running 50 of my weird cards  Next match Shaman  Then 2 more warlocks   neither zoo nor quest  Then 2 more Shamans  Then an RNG Mage   I think people dont notice it because if you play in the pool of current meta decks youll get matched with one of them anyway   Just because you a wearing a tinfoil hat doesnt mean you are necessarily wrong \", \"commentId\": \"36202\", \"commentDate\": \"1493341024\"}, {\"comment\": \"at 6 health hunter has knife juggler and a 11
