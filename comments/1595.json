only rotates out soon  but also requires dat sweet  sweet cashola  Its sooooooo fuuuuun to spend a lot of time to  build deck after deck  only to win once and then lose about 9 times to every standard Renolock  Renomage and Jade golemdruid in existance  because they managed to either get really lucky with whatever cards they draw from the packs  or manage to somehow gather up enough dust for about 4 legendaries in one deck    really makes a freetoplay player feel welcome\", \"commentId\": \"33498\", \"commentDate\": \"1489260494\"}, {\"comment\": \"5 straight mage opponents in Arena  Thanks blizzard  This is fun\", \"commentId\": \"33499\", \"commentDate\": \"1489260889\"}, {\"comment\": \"So we have suffered the shit of getting swamped by Jade Druid or outvalued by Jade Shaman or outwaited by Renoanything or outcurved by Dragon Priest for weeks now  The nerfs were too late and have had a small effect on pirate warrior but it is still nearly unbeatable unless you play one of the previously mentioned decks  Blizzards business model is now CRYSTAL clear release an expansion or adventure that creates some sets of cards that lead to decks that have an unfair advantage sell as many packs as possible while people flock to the broken decks happy to be winning keep a stream of press appearances and community QA sessions going talking about monitoring the meta and letting players work it out  Eventually dissatisfaction at the broken cards reaches a critical value  by then sales of the cancer cards have reached saturation levels anyway   Announce a few nerfs that were obviously needed from day 2  milk the broken cards for another 23 weeks  make the nerfs  announce the next expansion set of broken cards to repeat the business cycle  Its a gigantic con  Ladder advancement for 99 of players now means playing the currently broken decks  The promise of building a collection of cards that might be put to future use in even semieffective ladder decks is revealed to be a lie  Advancing on ladder UNLESS playing one of the broken meta decks is nearly impossible  Because the broken meta decks are so effective they poison wild and casual as well as standard  If you are happy to pay Blizzard lots of money to play the top netdecks you can have a winning season   NEVER GIVE BLIZZARD MONEY FOR THIS CON\", \"commentId\": \"33500\", \"commentDate\":

\"commentDate\": \"1489262801\"}, {\"comment\": \"I agree with everything you said   You also forgot that in order to keep the sales up  keep the decks fairly braindead to play so any moron sitting on the toilet can play the broken decks   You also forgot to mention how they loathe the very player base that gives them money  the guac boy commercial was a good example of them insulting their own player base   I will give them one more chance with this next expansion   After that it will be daily quests and no more   The only reason why I even would do that is because I already do have too much time and money in this game to give it up completely   That should have also been another point of yours   Get people invested in the game emotionally and financially so they can never feel good about completely walking away from it  always keep people hopeful about the next expansionadventure\", \"commentId\": \"33502\", \"commentDate\": \"1489266920\"}, {\"comment\": \"You and I have disagreed on lots of things but on this Im in total agreement with all your points  I doubt Ill ever spend money on packs again  Ill gradually become even less competitive and Ive no doubt the next expansion will create a handful of new decks that people will ride to high ranks just because the decks play themselves and forgive misplays  Gradually I will wean myself of Hearthstone  GG Blizzard
