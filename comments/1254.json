cards like Tunnel Trogg  Totem Golem  Flamewreathed etc  and in some games I had the board presence  until COTW came down  It didnt matter if I had the board pressence or not  the fact is that the

can get out of it feels empty and unsatisfying  Im actually removing random effect cards from my decks when possible  I dont mind the discover mechanic as you can control the outcome to some extent  but Yogg    I replaced the card with Nefarian  Sure  it still has some randomness but at least it doesnt decide the game instantly  Yogg should just be removed from Ranked altogether  What is the point of 2030minute games when the outcome is decided by the roll of a dice\", \"commentId\": \"26324\", \"commentDate\": \"1474823947\"}, {\"comment\": \"Blizzard are ignorant fuckheads  The game is
