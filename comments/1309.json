at 4 stars in about 10 min  then    Midrange Shaman  Obviously  I lost because he can always roll Lightning Storm at maximum   Then I went straight up losing down to 1 star and had to grind again  lose another promo to another shaman  I won the 3rd promo because my opponent was a CThun Warrior  Its frustrating when you think a lot about your plays on a fucking hunter and you get highrolled by some bs RNG like Lightning Storm  Anyway  good luck I cant even wish you to play well because that doesnt even matter that much see all the Midrange Shamans out there misplaying and misplaying and still getting the victory\", \"commentId\": \"27462\", \"commentDate\": \"1477837029\"}, {\"comment\": \"like someone said before  i agree with the implement of a way to block encounters with one
