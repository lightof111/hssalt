"[{\"comment\": \"I just played THREE pirate bloody warriors  in a row  All three had exactly the SAME opening cards and play    Stupid hook thing  pirate then the pirate that runs in    next turn he has something like a 62 pirate with charge and a weapon with 5 attack    WTF  Not only is it UNFAIR to be that aggressive by turn 2   its BORING to play against the same deck constantly  Can we have more shamans  druids and warlocks please even though that Jade thing is annoying  Warriors are currently more annoying than even Quest rogues\", \"commentId\": \"38552\", \"commentDate\":

don t have them dead by turn 4 or 5  youre done  Pirate warriors dont bother me as much as they used to because I play decks that deal with them fairly well\", \"commentId\": \"38553\",

right  wiping out enough cards to give me a shot at survival  But when they can just drop the 1 mana charge cards and hit you  then recall it  then drop it again  rinse  repeat  etc  it is hopeless\",

Hybrid Druiddeck BigWide  2 Ice Blocks first 12 cards from his deck into Alexstrasza  primordial glyph into volcanic potion to counter my living mana with no removal in hand  fireball x2  firelands portal x2 first 14 to 16 cards     So for the first time in like whatever  I actually get a good card draw 1 mana 11 with weapon  no patches in hand and next turn 2 21chargers against Reno priest that goes second  So I drop my 11 with weapon and attack his face  He counters it with a potion of madness  I drop my 2 chargers  and think to myself hell probably wont have another potion of madness to counter this  and can follow it up with a Southsea captain the next turn to prevent another PoM  He drops a wild pyromancer and coins his Crystalline Oracle  I think Ok  this is unusual  but whatever  I drop my frothing Berserker and kill his WP  He drops his Deathlord  I draw my Heroic Strike to kill his Deathlord together with my frothing  and I get a Southsea captain from my deck  I think to myself good  he must have no way to counter this yet since he played his coin already on turn  so he cant holy Nova yet  He then plays his Shadow Word Madness  Im starting to get triggered now  and think to myself what type of deck is this guy playing The next turn I play my 43charger  and my 13murloc  He then plays his Bran  power word shield  so I kill it with my arcanite reaper the next turn with the 13 and go face again  Im like ok  how does he remove this 43 He plays his holy Nova and trades with his 11  I then play my 23 that gets buffed by my weapon  and my 2nd Southsea Captain  Im like Ok  I finally have the board now  and I can do significant damage next turn  He then plays his dragonfire potion  WTF is this RNG Hes literally playing a Reno deck  and the odds of drawing those exact cards  in exactly the right order  should be very slim  But no  this is Hearthstone  and RNG shits on me every time  Oh  the next turn he plays his Harrison Jones to destroy my AR  Maybe its time we stand up against all this bullshit and just boycott this game  cause Im getting sick  tired of all this bullshit ass RNG  And whats the point of playing  if nearly every game is decided by a coin flip You might just flip a coin IRL then  and save yourself the time that youre wasting on this BS game  Why do they even have an Esports scene Its a fkin joke  Look at the tourneys theyre playing now Spring Championship and Global Games  Nearly every game probably 80 or higher is decided by RNG  Whats the point in playing this game competitively then If you have no significant influence on the outcome of the matches that youre playing  then why play it at all\", \"commentId\": \"38558\", \"commentDate\": \"1496931047\"}, {\"comment\": \"Even at rank 10  a rank that is

although they always have loads more low cost minions than me so even then its usually a lose  I find pirate warriors SO annoying as I cannot beat them with my current deck  I think I will need to
