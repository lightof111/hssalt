kid you not  i have received 3 ADDITIONAL finjas  the 3rd coming today on christmas   To add to this  I have  opened ANOTHER 3 of those stupid draw cards until you draw one that isnt a dragon forgot the name but I assure you its not worth looking up  I guess many of you are saying eff  at least youre opening legendaries  But man my experience has just been absurd  I dont remember the last time i
