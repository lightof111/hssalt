"[{\"comment\": \"Fuck Anyfin paladin  The whole premise of the deck is annoy your opponent until you have your full powered anyfin then kill them with it  You clear the board OVER AND OVER so your opponent cant play minions with out them getting killed almost instantly  sometimes you play Nzoth  then you just kill your opponent in one turn while there is literally nothing they can do unless they are priest  You cant kill the murlocs cause then they kill you  you cant let them live cause they kill you youre literally fucked unless youre playing priest  Fuck that god damn deck  it is completely antifun for your opponent\", \"commentId\": \"25290\", \"commentDate\": \"1472931574\"}, {\"comment\": \"So MidRange Hunter it is the best deck in the history of hearthstone  It is just absurd  They deal you 8 damage per turn since turn 34 and then all fucking games are the same Turn 6 Highmane  Turn 7 some ridiculous burst turn 8 call of the skill and there you go your 24 health it is gone  I dont know what to do  maybe ropping every turn or just concede if I see a hunter  Im 932 against that deck and the 9 victories are against some weird versions with secretkepper so technically I cant beat regular mid range hunter and the worst thing it is that is really easy to play I mean I won 910 games with hunter but I have fucking morality and I play for fun  Honestly I dont care if all of them get heartattack while playing  so free win  just humans I dont know so who cares\", \"commentId\": \"25291\", \"commentDate\": \"1472932212\"}, {\"comment\": \"Alright  You freakin assheads made me sick again   So starting the new season on rank 18  I decide not to play an aggro or tempo deck  so I modify a CThun Warrior and start playing  All I got is some guys that play decks with 10 legendaries in and almost zero heal  So I lose because I cant press aggresively and I dont have all the removal for these  Then I got a guy who played like a freakin control Mage with 2 Flamestrikes 2 Blizzards 2 Avian Watchers and a crapload of secrets and no heal at all  And on top of that he played Reno on Fatigue   So I have a question you dense motherfuckers  HOW THE FUCK DO YOU DEAL AGAINST AGGRO DECKS  So you called it Im playing Dragon Warrior from now on  Good luck imbeciles now   May you stay for all eternity on Rank 20\", \"commentId\": \"25292\",
