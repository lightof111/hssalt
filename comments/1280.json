a mediocre Arena player   usually between 48 wins  So it means I got at least 34 wins with every deck I made  but this time I went 13  43 and 03 twice  In the beginning I thought What is happening to me Am I playing ranked  because my opponents always had the right answers which fits perfectly to the situation  And when I say always its ALWAYS  Perfect card draws  their RNG based cards dealt the maximum damage or summoned the best possible minions  And when I finally won a game it wasnt the Yes Victory X more to go feeling  When I was in 3 wins I seriously considered to hit the retire button because I didnt enjoy any of them  Horrible  long  painful games  Usually there were two situations   When I played a card it was immediately removed from the field  I cant even damaged my opponents hero  Dead before turn 10   When I played a card it was mostly immediately removed from the field but somehow I managed to overwhelm my opponent and set up board control I must  When I left a 11 minion on the board it was 99 next turn  In the end my opponents health was below 10 while mine was above 20  Still lose  Piloted Shredder  Doomsayer 1 health  Alexstrasza  removal after removal  heavy taunt after heavy taunt  So I think I take a break from Arena for a while  And I never thought that someday I wrote a post to this Salt Thread but  wah\", \"commentId\": \"26855\",

minions  uses PO on the Councilman  Soulfires my face  discards a Possessed Villager and Soulfires my face again for lethal  Playing Zoo vs Tempo Mage  He has no minions on the field  I have a 32  another 32  a 12 Voidwalker and a 22 Juggler  He plays Flamewaker  uses Arcane Blast on one 32  the two missiles hit the Juggler  He then plays coin and the two missiles hit my other 32  Finally he plays Mirror Image and the last missiles finish my Voidwalker off  Finishes his turn with two Hellos  I played against a Ressurect Priest with my Control Shaman  I Hexed his first Injured Blademaster to screw his Ressurects and Bishops but later he played Barnes  got YShaarj and he put Rag in play  I killed his board and he proceeded to Ressurect Bishop next turn  getting YShaarj as a 1010 back alongside Rag and YShaarj played the 2nd Blademaster as a 47  I cleared the board again and next turn he cast another Bishop2nd Ressurect and Rag returned alongside YShaarj  It was too much so I conceded  Never saw that 01 frog  the Priest of the Feast  Barnes or the Loot Hoarder showing up from the RessurectsBishops  Hell  even an Injured Blademaster would have been better than YShaarj or
