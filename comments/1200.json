1313 Cthun which had to hit him twice to win and he had 3 minions on the board and it didnt hit him once ffs I lost 13 1 in 4s  13     Then I lost because Cthun was in my bottom 6 cards  then because he was in my bottom 5 cards the game after    Then I lose because we reach fatigue and a mage deck  which had a duplicate of just about every card ran Reno  because he some how knew he was gonna reach fatigue this game or somethin And the other two were bullshit aggro shamans  Which are retarded right now  I lost against an aggro shaman who was probably the worst player I had ever seen  yet he beat me with 16 hp spare and I was hunter  Like seriously he did stuff like rock biter his mana tide totem just to hit me and evolve that 1 drop trog that shamans have as opposed to a jewled scarab  He even opened the game by Abusive seargant  coin  that trog 1 drop  1 turn he even forgot to attack yet he still beat me easily Such bollocks man wtf\", \"commentId\": \"25119\", \"commentDate\":

deck have some fun and rank up good  I still have a positive winrate but its goes to slow for me and I get tilted every time i face a stupid agro shaman or agro hunter and know on turn 3 or 4 I already lost the game  Why is  this game playing on curve just the best thing to do  I played some Elder Scrolls Legends when the beta got out  and there you get punished for being agresive Your opponent draws a card if you every time he lost 5 health What makes it  less likely to go straight face  If something like that came in hearthstone it would be so nice\", \"commentId\": \"25121\",

now its res priest   Priest has always been op with their insane amount of hard removal  but its really pushed over the edge now with resurrection and lord of the feast  This is a deck which requires 0 skill to play  Drop lord of the feast  spam spells  win  If your opponent gets even a halfway decent draw  it is impossible to beat   Any threat you play is removed immediately  and anything you remove from the board is immediately returned to play  If you try to go face  he just heals himself faster than you can do damage   This is an unbeatable deck  and there really should not be any such

you just autoconcede at the beginning of the game because you dont want to play against it  For me it would be Yogg  I made my first semisuccessful deck and its hard to play and often only barely breaks the 50 winrate threshold  Im tired of working hard to make a come back and then just when Im about to win against an unfavored matchup Yogg gets dropped and my opponent refills his hand  clears my board  and goes from no board presence to a scary board presence\", \"commentId\": \"25131\", \"commentDate\": \"1472655074\"}, {\"comment\": \"Casual  hunters everywhere  Ranked  hunters
