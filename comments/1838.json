how can this be a thing to deal over 11dmg on turn 4 sure  i need to draw the right cards in the right order  so he can not build a board  aswell as he has to draw the right cards to get his board so stable in early turns    yeah i know   but wait if i dont play aggro i still have to build in some wincondition in my deck and well of course some control tools  so my deck gets filled with cards that
