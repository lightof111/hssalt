speculation about the matchmaking algorithm  I returned midseason this month after a break from the game  and laddered from 22 to 8 almost effortlessly  I did not record my win rate but it felt like I

down to 10 and cant seem to ladder back up  Res priest  res priest  token druid  paladin with ragnaros  res priest  res priest  res priest  res priest  token druid  res priest  paladin  res priest

the point of running same ranked decks in casual mode 99 of the opponents playing same deck  To make it worse  Huntards have gone too far with their retarded same deck and card Call of the Wild  Today out of 30 matches  I faced 16 Huntards  6 Shamans  5 Druids and 3 Mages  Guess what I was playing against only 4 people  Because all them had SAME DECK  There is absolutely 0 creativity  If someone comes up with a deck  instead of copying it and playing nonstop  how about making it better Sure you can play it few times to see how it works  but at least try to make it better or different  The midrange  aggro tag is just for lulz  Both run same cards  just 12 different cards and BAM Midrange WTF Its plain aggro deck  Is everyone playing  just to hit X rank and call it a proud achievement
