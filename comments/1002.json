{\"comment\": \"There was an expansion  and the introduction of wild and standard  Its pretty obvious why people stop complaining about a card or specific deck  and started hating other ones  Its even more understandable when with the expansion new op broken cards are introduced  If you look closely  you can even see that they do this to cards and classes that didnt see no play  So nobody plays secrets on Paladin lol let me just make a card that pulls out your secrets from the deck and puts them on the table  Make this card purple so you can have two on your deck and have more possibilites of having it on curve  I want to see if paladin secrets are unplayable now  So you are telling me that Shaman is a non class inside HS  that nobody ever plays them in ladder or tournaments lol I will design a hand full of new op cards that will make the worst class of Hs in the new wrecking ball  that every retard why two brain cells will want to play this shit  And best thing is that they can do that shit and still be loved by all the fan boys\", \"commentId\": \"20892\", \"commentDate\": \"1464522524\"}, {\"comment\": \"Priests are fucking OP  Since 2 Days i won against every other class

do it at an animal shelter which is pretty far away basically just walk dogs and clean  but I always try to fit it in and usually land on about 2 hours every week  My social life is basically always with friends at school  sometimes play football and sometimes go out on saturday evenings  Both my school and gym are about a 15 minute bicycle ride  I do have to admit that I didnt really do shit for school  or slept alot  still managed to make it though  And I play sports from 1200 to 1400 on saturday  Trust me  its not bs  The reason I managed to keep this schedule is because I enjoy doing a lot
