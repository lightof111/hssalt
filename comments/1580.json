against Pirate Warrior anyway  my problem is that Ive never seen so many weird tech cards andor Decks especially at the start of the month    I expected to play against a plethora of Jade Druids and not to lose to a Warlock just cause I mulliganed for what has been the only Warlock Deck on ladder for the past 3 months and instead I got someone playing the most inconsistent Deck out there that still somehow managed to draw all his early game stuff     I know I should be happy the meta seems a bit more varied than before Even though I know that higher on ladder nothing really changed that much but it still pisses me off that I have to lose not cause I misplayed or got outplayed but merely because of surprise effect\", \"commentId\": \"33179\", \"commentDate\": \"1488793328\"},

playing it for years  But god  am I getting tired of it sometimes  Ive been playing HS for 3 years now  Highest rank Ive ever archieved Rank 9  Most months I usually end up around rank 15  Whenever friends observe me friends who reach legend every month they always tell me that Im just very unlucky  Im not perfect  so I make mistakes aswell  but not often  Whenever I see those legend friends play I know Id respond the same as they do in their games  The difference When they play netdecks they get the card draw they need  They dont play against people who topdeck every right answer possibly  Whenever I play a netdeck Im always stuck with cards I dont need at that moment  If theres a game I am somewhat lucky with card draw the other party always well 9  out of 10 has the perfect counter  Its just so unfair  This game is so much RNG and yet the same people reach legend every month without any major issues  I play as well  use the same decks  but I always face the perfect counter  or I lack the correct card draw  I lose VS a Jade Druid when I play Reno  My response Well  let me go Jade myself  What happens I face decks that counter Jade Druids perfectly  Or I face Reno decks with the most perfect draw possible  I know that I should stop playing for a while when Im in a big lose streak  but it happens every day  Every month  Every year  I watch gameplay videos  I observe legend places  they observe me  but yet I just cant consistently reach rank 10 which is all I want tbh  Its just impossible  BAH\", \"commentId\": \"33182\", \"commentDate\": \"1488800716\"},

want to leave salt here  i want to leave anger over a certain player i played renopriest  he played renolock  i DID NOT emote anything  i DID NOT rope i topdecked two cards dragonpotion to remove his giant which he had in his starting hand and entomb for his twilightdrake which he also had in his starting hand  he didnt mulligan those cards  they showed up on the first place i could deal with the giant and drake in other ways but the topdecked cards were the best answers  so what happened he managed to play a jaraxxus and kept his life over 8  out of reach of my kazakus spell  he won props to him he deserved the win but then on his lethal turn he FUCKING ROPED i sent a request for asking him why  he accepted  postet a copypasted text that sad something like that fuckyou for topdecking the right answers every turn  get rekt you RNGplayer and then he INSTANTLY removed me  this behavior is really bothering me 1  he got offended by me playing cards      what 2  he ROPED on his lethal turn  3  he accused me of stupid shit and instantly left  so that i could not defend myself  now i just could say yes  he is a prick  let him be and move on  but i just cant do that  i can stand losses and insults  i know better  but i HATE this kind of people  i dont get why you just cant get yourself together and play the game with at least a bit of respect for your opponents\", \"commentId\":
