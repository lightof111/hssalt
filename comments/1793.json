"[{\"comment\": \"Last night I met some secret mage in wild casual and I was playing pirate warrior that version with dbs and cannons  I had a 40gold quest play 30 warrior cards  So as I dont have Justicar or warriors quest I decided to play this deck  however I usually play Malygos shaman and Im not really a fan of pirate warrior  Ive not seen such a madoveravideogame person in a veryvery long time  He was literally devastating me with insults and other shit  I couldnt even find an answer to him cuz his rage was just    meh  So my message to that guy if you are reading this post  please forgive me to play that stupidass deck  Im not a little autistic kid Im 22 and wasnt diagnosed as autistic and Im so fucking sorry for your losses\", \"commentId\": \"37591\", \"commentDate\":

so I could actually have fucking fun  Yeah  so much fun  If this shit keeps happening minus fucking well have blizzard take standard away and just go back to the way it fucking was  8 people in a row  all quest rogue  I can beat thats luck of the fucking draw and Im getting sick of playing the same damned thing   Fuck Hearthstone and its fun  interactive game Yeah  so interactive when my opponent floods field turn 3  completes the quest turn 4  then uses prep to activate it  Im so fucking tired of trying to get out of rank 1510 only to get beat back up to 15 no stars every time I get close to leaving that section because of the slew of quest rogues in wild that I run into  Go back to standard you fucking piece of scum players  Let the people who want a fun game have fun   Not saying I cant take loosing  Ive lost my fair share of games but at least those games were fun and I actually got to play the game  Quest rogue basically means if you cant deal with their board off turn 2 you auto lose  Fuck this quest\", \"commentId\": \"37592\", \"commentDate\": \"1495115106\"}, {\"comment\": \"What was Blizzard thinking with quest rogue There werent enough golden portrait rogues out there so they had to give them auto wins They really have to do something  Maybe kill charge on all cards when quest is played  This bullshit of returning charge minions and then cost 2 less is so OP its

{\"comment\": \"I feel you Between this and Caverns Rogue  Hearthstones really taken a turn for the worst  I try playing wild to get away from those decks and people still take them into wild  Hearthstone took Conceal away from Rogues because it wasnt interactive for players and yet they create something thats pretty much like conceal where your opponent cant interact with a mages board because 90 of the game is spent holding cards in your hand and cockblocking your opponent with ice blocks and other secrets until they can 1 turn OKO you from 30 health  Theres been times I should have won a game and the mage pulls a third ice block from a random generator cabalists tome or primordial glyph  blocks my full board from killing them  then pulls the combo off the following turn and kills me  Some of these things need some major balancing  Though to be quite honest  Id rather play against quest mage than quest rogue because at least theres a chance of killing the mage before they get all the combo pieces  If the mage cant get all the combo pieces they can only stall for so long  Rogue on the other hand just spams small things and theres so many bounce cards and cards that generate more cards that they have far more starting fuel than the mage does leaving many opponents unable to react to a board generated by turn 4 thats been prepd into crystal core  Only early game clear is the spell that costs 3 or 2 with coin and even then its not enough\", \"commentId\": \"37607\", \"commentDate\": \"1495121019\"}, {\"comment\": \"At this stage  the only thing Id pay for
