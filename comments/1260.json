reasoning behind their nerfs   Blizz is nerfing cards based on salt threads What a lame company  Show some numbers before you just nerf things  Their nerfs look like they come from a random nerf  thread as opposed to looking at the number and tier of decks that use those cards  The closest they get to using numbers is COTW is overperforming at 8 mana  It is a card that casts 3 3 mana cards    DUH its a value at 8  Most 2nd graders can tell you 3x39 not 8  Do Shamans need nerf Duh    Tier 1 and running strong since WoGLoE even  So not against the nerfs but a lot of these couldve been addressed by not having crappy designs   Quote from Blizz In many cases  dusting off old cards can be good for the game  and allow our players to create and expand on new themes  even if they may not have a place in the current meta   Of course blizz wants you to dust your cards  regret it and buy more packs   Didnt even talk about ones out of rotation  Why make bad cards then blizzard More quotes from Blizzard We felt like seeing Yogg in tournaments was not where we originally hoped it would end up   So what was your plan You created a card but didnt want any pros to ever use it in the competitive scene WTF    truly WTF  Aggressive decks are stronger than we would like right now  and Abusive Sergeant is in virtually all of them Then stop coming out with ridiculously strong 1 drops Tunnel trogg that can get to 5 damage fairly quickly  Also The Give your minion 2 damage for 2 mana at 12 will still be played in its place  and 2 This was obvious back when leper gnome was 21    I dunno how they miss these obvious things from the standard release nerf   Also surprised its rockbiter and tuskarr totemic getting the nerfs  I get that tuskarr summoning a 3 mana totem is ridiculous but hes still a 5 value for 3 summoning a basic totem for free   By moving it to 9 mana we intend to tone down its power enough that it wont be an automatic inclusion in every Hunter deck and overshadow other strategies  So their basic nerf strategy is anything that is an auto include shouldnt be  I dont hate the nerfs nearly as much as the faulty reasoning \", \"commentId\": \"26440\",

bring the total damage to 14   The player now has two legendaries on the board and I have nothing  Game over\", \"commentId\": \"26450\", \"commentDate\": \"1475108683\"}, {\"comment\": \"I dont agree with you but its nice to hear some vocalisation on your sideofthecoin  rather than just BLIZZARD NURF SUX  so I applaud you for that but I just want to describe how I see this   They obviously tried something with Call of the Wild  The animal companions are synonymous with the Hunter class so having a spawn all 3 was a natural progression  As I see it the reasoning for 8 Mana was the Hero power  Weaving in the Hero power on Turn 10 means that isnt 7 charge Damage for 10 mana  King Krush is better that this looking at it this way you can start to understand why 8 mana sounded reasonable  It wasnt and they changed it I think 9 mana makes much more sense  At least they admitted the mistake and fixing it  right Shaman design isnt crappy Just all in one package the RNG effect and now multiple board clears make it really strong  Tuskar meant it could steamroll the early game just with a good roll  Later game minions like thing from below and Thunderbluff and balanced enough In my eyes  You could see they just wanted to give shaman totem synergy  they went a little far and now its fixed   This frustrated me Why make bad cards   This is an idiotic phrase  In reality something cannot be classed as good or bad without something to compare it to  even then it can be situational  There is no doubting some are better than others  that comes with the territory but bad cards dont really exist   If you had looked around at the prostreamer scene these changes  or atleast a look  were put forward be notable figures  These prosstreamer play tens or games daily  they know what works and what doesnt  Look at Batstone  that was firebat and other pro players sending a message to blizzard that the game can still be fun WITHOUT these cards  Blizzard didnt have to change them but sometimes it take someone to stand up and shout about something to realise it may have been a mistake   Im glad blizzard is making an effort to try and fix things rather than just leaving us with the mess it creates  With a game this big and intricate you are bound to make mistakes in a design capacity  it takes big balls to stand up and admit you were wrong  This is them doing that\",
