10 was easy  Now I cant even get past bloody rank 14 somehow  I just concede whenever im at 150 stars again due to all the boring netdeckers  I try to build my own decks  elemental shaman  spell priest stuff like that  But HS only rewards those who pick a tier 1 labeled deck  Sometimes this meta feels so terrible due to lack of originality  I have seriously met 0 people in my last 15 matches who made a deck I did not see on this frontpage  I know I rant a lot in this thread but today is one of those extra salty days  And Im not exaggerating about the originality of decks  I know people can make their own decks  I know most of them are similar  But sometimes it feels like 1 person makes a deck and 1000 people follow  It just sucks\", \"commentId\": \"36415\", \"commentDate\":

dragonfire value  I might possibly be able to bait his dragonfire if he has also drawn that he had drawn insanely well all game  so why not  Yep  uses obvious dragonfire  Now I need to start pressuring him due to his card advantage and fill the board with minions I held back  Topdeck 2nd dragonfire  Now Im not saying what I did was rocket science  but if the priest had to make AT LEAST

topic and also in regular games On many occasions  randoms minions die at the end of my turn for no absolute reason  Ive been playing long enough to know most cards and most effects and I can guaranty there is no logical explanation for my most left minion to just disappear at the end of my turn and not even show up in the move list in the left column  Also  When playing arena  I will get random losses    Played an arena run 2 days ago  Was 71  Turned on game  played another and won  Should of been 81  it was 82    How the hell can this be possible  I played one game    then about an hour later I get back in and it said failed to connect to your last game  Best part is I contacted customer support and never got a reply  At this point Im willing to admit that Blizzard is flat out trying to make money from forcing losses  I would be owed at least 3 arena runs from how many times this happens  and since I never expect it I can never record it as proof  You work your ass off to get the gold to do an arena run  you sometimes spend money out of your own pocket and this crap happens  Kinda makes me hates this game  Rarely any rewards for the amount of effort you put in  And when you do get some its basically nothing  Am I the only one Fuck  as mentioned  I am allowed\", \"commentId\": \"36433\", \"commentDate\": \"1493749982\"}]"
