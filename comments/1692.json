awful to play against   All three are entire brainless and simple too  Quest rogue doesnt even need to be discusssed  Its an automatic win unless you play cancer pirate  Freeze mage with unlimited

played Thats against the game rules Isnt it Delete that card  Forever  Ill deal with flamewaker all day Versus unlimited freezing and removal followed by an unstoppable OTK from full health  Its

manage to create a balanced card game after 4 years now or more if you also count the development  you either play one of your 3 viable bullshit aggro decks or youre stuck at your rank forever  not going to say you wont rank up at all  but it takes ages and in the long run  meta defining decks like quest rogue or pirate warrior are going to fuck you up  it is so fucking sad and Im starting to feel this was blizzards intention all along  so people desperately purchase even more packs to play mentioned decks  thus making the meta game even less diverse and annoying to play in\",

you ask me  my 12 year old cousin could do better than them  he in fact pointed out several valid problems with the game and offered solutions that are far and beyond what team 5 could ever think of
