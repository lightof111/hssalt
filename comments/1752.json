dont have to think about  You make it to rank 5 with pirate warrior  apparently for you this is some sort of accomplishment lol  But hey man  have fun goin face  not improving in any other aspect of

seriously long time  all great things   And then  having dug down  all the way through my deck  I topdecked my last card into lethal  in the craziest way Ive ever done it  And then misplayed  and lost   Literally lost because I wasnt paying enough attention to hit with Divine Spirit first  and then Inner Fire   If Id lost normally  Id be pretty proud to make it that far  but to trip literally with lethal in hand   Its not fun\", \"commentId\": \"36751\", \"commentDate\": \"1494113148\"}, {\"comment\": \"Yes I am Some people like us just need a bit of miracle rogues in our lives \",

favourite deck to play againstnah  normally i try to keep calm when facing it  but one thing that annoys me the most is when people missplay and i mean a lot and at the end they just win  cause their deck was the favoured one in the certain MUlike im playing control priest  yes  i understand that QR is the favoured one  BUT ffs i had a medium board  1 radiant elemental  1 cleric  1 tar creeper and 1 Tolvir Stoneshaper  nothing too oppressive  but the fun part starts after when i played the stoneshaper1 they then used their chargers 1 boar  1 deckhand and patches  which could have potentially become 55s  just to get rid of the divine shield of the stoneshaper  after that they just stood awkwardly on the board and I killed them2 the card they bounced was novice and even on the following turn my opp just played her as a 11 instead of getting the reward3 and believe it or not they used 2 chargers on my Blazecaller in one of the following turns instead of chargerdagger and they werent low on healththey won because they used vanish and i was unable to establish a board  i couldnt clear with dragon fire  because they had Igneous Elemental and got more tokensand on their last turn their board was full of 55s  some with taunt    as IF i didnt do anything in that gameSUCH BS  honestly  never hated a deck more than this one\", \"commentId\": \"36759\", \"commentDate\":
