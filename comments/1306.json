or a slower control game and always have something good to play on every turn   Its the most braindead  auto pilot deck ever in the history of the game   Thats why ladder is infested with them   Cant

youre playing one of those two  Im at the point where I dont expect to win games or ladder properly anymore  I just ignore my starsrank because its not worth it anymore  Last season I finished at rank 8 no problem  the highest I got this season is 12 and I cant stay there very long   Clearly your abilityskill as a player doesnt really matter  I didnt get 4 ranks worse at playing the game

going up against a shaman and he got 2 bloodlusts on the same turn  SERIOUSLY Yet when I try to play shaman  I cant keep totems on the board  Everyone I play against just removes every single totem  Its bullshit   Youve made several bad plays You have 1 hp left No problem  just play your savage roar card and win the game   I did get really salty when I was playing miracle rogue against a freeze mage  You know  seeing how freeze mage basically sucks as a deck right now  Anyway  I have 27 damage on the board between my buffed Questing Adventurer and Edwin Van Cleef as well as 3 other minions  So thats it  Ive won  Hes failed to remove my most dangerous minions  I have lethal  game over   Ice Block is up  which is fine  thats what I would have done and I knew it was up because he played it early on and no other secrets popped  No problem  I win on the next turn   Frost Nova  Ok  good play  thats what I would have done  Fireball to the face  Ok fine  I hate that mage always goes spells to the face but whatever   Next turn  ok I got this  Frost Nova again  Shit  Well  whatever  Hes just stalling  Hes used up both of his novas  he has nothing left  Hes done  Dead in the water  Ill definitely win on the next turn  No way he has enough spells in hand to get lethal  Except he does  Roaring Torch x2 to the face  COME ON What are the chances of having two copies of both of those
