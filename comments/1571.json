month because the meta was boring as shit and the goal I was working towards Golden Hunter was pretty much impossible to achieve  Saw the patch and figured that plus starting at Rank 20 this month would lend itself to a slightly more diverse meta  First 10 games 10 Pirate Warriors  Im starting to think my pattern with Hearthstone might consist of me only logging in once every three days to complete my dailies and only playing ranked for the first week or two after new expansions are released  At this point Im really not sure why Im continuing to play a game that I so rarely enjoy  I seriously have more fun throwing together a deck consisting of 30 random class cards for a quest and running into casual than Ive had playing ranked for at least the past 2 months\", \"commentId\":

POSSIBLE TO ALWAYS HAVE THE PERFECT HAND AGAINST ME  WHILE I GET NOTHING Ive been in top 100 legend multiple times on that one day in average where Im somehow not unluckier than everyone else in the month  so why the fuck cant I even gain a star at rank 15 Why does EVERYONE have the most insane start possible no matter which class they play I am so furious that Im ashamed of myself  this should NOT be possible  the combined chances for all my bullshit RNG and perfect drops happening against me is so unreal it cant even be properly measured anymore  This shit is rigged  there is absolutely no other explanation  I honestly wish I was just tilting and playing really bad to somehow lose almost all of my games this season  because at least I would have a reason  but no  its literally jut bullshit insane RNG puked at my face every single time  and I have no idea what have I done against the universe that it hates me this much  Ive been playing this joke called a game for more than 2 years  I perfectly know the difference between bad plays and insane luck  Take a break they say  even if I do for days  this same shit just keeps happening at the first game again  I dont even know why I keep playing  I guess I am waiting for this ridiculous RNG to at least normalize a little on the long term  but it just doesnt happen  and this fact is way  way  way more infuriating than the fact that Im losing every game because of it\", \"commentId\": \"32997\", \"commentDate\": \"1488447158\"}, {\"comment\": \"favourite comment in this thread  ever\", \"commentId\": \"32998\",
