hard can it be when literally everyone had the right curve against me  Ofcourse I now face only classes Im bad against  or I just have a very crappy hand  At some point its just getting funny  Whenever I face a shaman I always tell my husband ah  turn 1  tunnel trogg  im sure  And of course that happens in 99 of the cases  Same with mages and mana wyrmbabbling book  Whichever class I play  I can suspect their curve  I can suspect that a priest always has a bran kazakus combo on turn 7 and an operative on turn 5  Whenever I play a control deck against priests  ofcourse they have big mind controls and entombs in hand  How hard can it be  right Just hard mulligan  But when I play those classes Im stuck with late endgame cards  or cards that are worthless at that stage of the game  I still play the game  because Im stubborn and because deep down  I enjoy the game  But when it takes you 87 games to rank between 20 and 15 Every time Im close to a rank up ofcourse I lose and end up in a losing streak again  I see the same people reach legend every single season and when they observe me they always tell me they wouldnt have done things any differently  Maybe 1 mis play in 5 games  or so  due to tilting  They just tell me I am unlucky  Meanwhile some people are still saying this game is built on skill  Perhaps thats how the game started  but now its just one big RNG fest  Been playing for years  played with every deck you can think of  but never made it past rank 9  The only reason why I made it to rank 15 this season I played Jade Aggro Shaman  Yes  Im ashamed  It seems like the only class people with bad luck can win with\", \"commentId\": \"33312\", \"commentDate\": \"1488972814\"}, {\"comment\": \"Fuck off you pirate dragon warrior wankers    Its not that I

the moment and wanted to buy the preorder bundle  But my god this game has become too frustrating and all I am facing is jades  Played 8 games tonight where I faced 7 Jades and 1 PW  I did not lose all my games  It is just boring as fuck  So I have deleted HS and I am not sure I will buy the preorder bundle I have bought all of them so far  I just cant stand the Jade mechanic  It takes so little skill to play and it can be so punishing  Oh a Jade Druid and I am playing Reno Priest  Okay  well Ill just try to tempo him out  Oh never mind I did not draw any early game  Well  thats pretty much game then Hey A Jade Druid more and I am playing reno mage  Okay  Ill try and stall the game and eventually burst him down  Wow  a 55 jade on turn 5 and I cannot draw a clear  Well thats pretty much game then   and yes I have beaten a lot of them and even with reno decks  and I am not saying jades er OP perhaps a bit in shaman at the moment due to their early game  Its just that the mechanic so fucking tedious I draw a jade  I play a jade  Wow  another jade  I guess Ill play that one too  Oh my  They are getting big now  Oh  I lost the board for some reason and my opponent gained it  Well  too bad  My deck is a onetrick pony and I can barely catch up on tempo  and I cant see how this changes as the mechanic is so suppressing to control decks  E g  I like Priest a lot and based on the quest Awaken the Makers it seems they are trying to push Nzoth Priest  A rather slow deck depending on the cards theyll release which will get snowballed like a motherfucker against Jades   Well  I am

its a slow  terrible deck mostly bc Rumbling Elemental is a slow  difficult to trigger card   After 8 days I have completely reinforced my opinion that standard is just an abysmal mode to play  Between R19 where I started the month and Rank 14 before Rumbling my way back to 16 I faced all exact copies of the same few decks  There is zero originality along the way  only Pirates  RenoKazakus  Dragon Priest  or Jades  How the fuck does anyone play this mode regularly Its sooooooo boring to literally face the exact same decklist over and over and over and over and over and over and over and

deck and it was so refreshing to play against All the rest are net decks  Boring  Standard has really taken a dive I feel  and its now even worse after the nerfs  You are punished for being creative
