streamers never get this unlucky  and queue up against people with normal luck or those who get punished by mistakes This shitty statistically impossible unluck that Im experiencing for months is a

RNG related elements at the moment  and I stopped because it proved my point I am way unluckier than the average  and its simple statistics  nothing more   My judgement is just as good as it was when I reached top100 a few months ago  I watch the hands of the opponents  try to play around class and deckspecific counters  and lets be honest  most of the time its autopiloting value throughout the games  Except back then I felt like my choices ingame mattered  now Im losing to RNG no matter what  As Im writing this  Im so low at the ladder that my shaman opponent managed to primal infusion my minion instead of his own  but I still died from 10hp because he topdecked ancestral knowledge into double lava burst on empty hand  How do you counter luck Im not saying I dont have those how the hell did I win this moments  but waaay less than most of the people\", \"commentId\": \"22613\", \"commentDate\": \"1468256792\"}, {\"comment\": \"I was keeping track of my Ragnaros triggers for a few weeks after an astoundingly unlikely string of unlucky fireballs going to my opponents face Out of 109 Ragnaros triggers that had minions on board  72 of them hit face 66  I wish I had thought to keep track of the numbers of minions on board as thats pretty important  but even if it was one minion every time which it wasnt  many times there were 24 minions  that number seems a little too far from 50 for my liking Being a reasonable person  I didnt cut Ragnaros from my list because doing so would be falling for the Gamblers fallacy  but some people really have terrible luck  Many of those raggoingface triggers cost me games  but in many of those games I was playing rag at inappropriate times just to get more triggers so Im not too upset about losing  It was just mind boggling to me\",

happened 1 in 3  max   and it actually changed the outcome of the games should be a really low chance overal for this to happen  for sure  Obviously you cant determine 100 the outcome before the RNG happening  but most of the time you get a close picture about it  And the result I lost 15 times from a winning position  and won only 4 times  And this doesnt include 5050s lost  topdecks  lowhigh rolls  perfect curves  having the perfect 2 counter cards within the first 10 cards  not even crazy Yoggs Another nice statistic Out of the 39 warriors I faced  32 had waraxe on turn 2  Cant really tell exact chance for that without knowing how many times were they on the coin or not  but let this sink in for just a second  And these have nothing to do with how bad or good someone plays  I can
