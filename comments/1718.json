against nothing but hunters last night with my freeze mage  I get this guy who was typically playing brainlessly and ignoring my minions and going face  I finally have him where I want him  Hes at 18 health and I am at 7 with both ice blocks popped  I have antonidas and thalnos on the board with a pyroblast and 4 fireballs in hand  Im so salty at all the hunters that I decide to emote him like an asshole until rope  Once rope comes up  I give him 1 last thank you and decide to overkill him  I throw pyroblast for 11  hit antonidas for 5  thalnos for 1  There he sits at 1 health  fuck my life  If I wasnt being an ass  I would have won  He had 1 card in hand so I figured my mistake wouldnt bite me since I was sitting at 7 health with an ice barrier in case he hit with weapon  He plays the 11 beast he had in hand followed by the kill command that he topdecked followed by hero power for lethal  The minute I saw the kill command graphic  I closed my iPad and went to bed\", \"commentId\":

the reason for so many hunters  If you dont beat them quickly they just end wasting your time and freezing your turn about 5 or 6 times while evading death twice at a minimum now with the discovergeneration of more ice blocks  Theyre lucky it would be 5 times the waste of time it is to even not concede as soon as I see a mage to rope them or I would do it  I only do that when I think i can win against something annoying AF that i am sick of seeing though  I will only risk wasting time roping against a mage when i am a hunter though  Something I am tired of having to play every year  But every time i do something more fun  I see a lot of psychopathic mages that are so uninteractive I may as well get up and have a cigarette while they sit and play with themselves literally for all I know  Then  when I put a secret eater  or a hunter with flare hoping to kill them by turn 4 to 6 I stop seeing them and as soon as I go back to something less monotonous low and behold three frakking mages in a row again    I am currently testing a new intercontinental ballistic missile as a final solution to the mage issue  I may commence more testing later today  or after the mxm beta ends  Roping will be an intuitive weapon in the arsenal to back it up as it could prove to be effective at forcing them to grind their teeth and concede for once  And knowing how psychopaths get off on and absolutely love to be in control  it sometimes hurts them the most when it is unexpectedly stripped from them  I would certainly fap to that if i can do it often enough  Honestly imagine the looks on their faces and their entitled looks of shock and rage while I do it  I will then look for streamers playing the uninteractive mages and do it to them so that I can have a visual for the after game faps  Mages are creating monsters and bitter players  the way that thief priests used before standard knocked a lot of problem cards out of rotation  Mages are worse since they often win while being a pita  and can take you from 30  0 in two turns  like  WTF    and thats at or nearing fatigue while not even being able to use most of your minions for most turns due to freezes and a million generated board clears  Its a waste of time to do anything BUT concede as soon as you see the mage portrait or if you dont win by turn 5 or 6 and have something to eat the ice block unless you are using a deck designed to screw with them but then you will usually lose to anything else   Frak mages\", \"commentId\": \"36040\", \"commentDate\": \"1493127048\"}, {\"comment\": \"I dont believe
