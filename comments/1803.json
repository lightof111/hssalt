Mulligan and Drawing rigging mechanism kicks in after the player goes on a win streak and usually after winning three or so games  I have faced using agro shaman after winning three games against a midrange Murloc Pally  going first  playing Vile Inquisitor turn 1  Rockpool Hunter turn 2  Murloc Warleader turn 3  Murloc Warleader turn 4  Gentle Mensaor turn 5  Anyone played Murloc pally before knows if you drew Vile Inquistor into Rockpool into Warleader against other agromidrange decks going first its a 90 win rate  2  Usually after going on a loss streak  the MMR rigging mechanism kicks in and match you up against with most favorable decks  I have lost 5 games in a row using Murloc MidRange Pally and then faced against other easy decks like Miracle Rogue with very bad draws  Taunt Warrior with no board clears and AggroToken druid and I drew all my board clears  taunt and Lightlord for heal  3  Playing Hunter Aggro after winning four games  vs Pirate Warrior  I drew nothing but 3 mana cards in Mulligan stage  Instant lose  4  Over the past 50 or so games  I have never faced Taunt Warriors on a consistent basis and 100 out of the matches are when I have had a losing streak  5  Switching to Control Pally deck and win a few games then get matched against Quest Rogue  Switched back to Aggro decks  no Quest Rogue queued for the next 20 games until switched to Control decks again  There are countless more examples and I think players should wake up to this charade instead of blaming everything on random and bad luck  There is nothing random about this game at least not above Rank 5\", \"commentId\": \"37794\", \"commentDate\": \"1495417615\"}, {\"comment\": \"this is fucking INSANE how screwed i am getting    im really surprised i havent broken everything in my room

be legend  Mages and up to 34 Ice Blocks  then a miracle discovery happens and youre dead  Mage I can tolerate since all you do is put in an Eater of Secrets and you stop facing them  Druid on the other hand is just utter stupidity  Theyre near death Lets just drop an Auctioneer on the board  wait until the rope almost ends while they gain 5 extra mana  a ridiculous board  and an extra 13 armor

ladder trying to have a bit of fun with an evolve Shaman  get matched up against quest rogue  pirate warrior     hate this socalled diverse meta so much the smorc decks are more cancerous than ever  and the control decks like taunt warrior and Jade Druid are so boring and unstoppable when they get to their end game  Really hate the netdecks and especially the big 5 piles of shit quest rogue  quest warrior  pirate warrior  murlocadin  midrange hunter    and those decks appear a LOT  Zero respect for anyone running that shite  Actually less than zero\", \"commentId\": \"37799\",

that smashes your face in turn 56  taunt warrior that slow rolls endless taunts then spams unstoppable fireballs  quest rogue that can have a board full of 55 by turn 5 or 6  murlocadin that can draw 13 into Rockpool into warleader  or midrange hunter that always seems to have alley cat into buff or hyena  If you are running the wrong kind of deck to compete you might as well just concede  Even if you have answers  drawing them too late makes them irrelevant  I suppose a lot of low IQ types like grinding those decks to win  but honestly  you could just hook them up to a bot and go do something else  Genuinely detesting the state of things right now\", \"commentId\": \"37801\", \"commentDate\": \"1495435312\"}, {\"comment\": \"22 in arena as priest  Find a paladin who turn Smugglers Run
