this game is that something like 10 of the cards are actually really  really good  and the remaining 90 are crap I dont know the actual statistics on that  and since really good is often subjective  thats as accurate as anything  Just get a handful of dust from some free packs or a few lucky hits and you can make the same netdecks that everyone is playing and win pretty consistently  No need to buyopen more after that    Then youre facing off against Aggro Shaman  Zoo  and all the other really cheap decks in the current meta every  single  match    Thats just a thought Ive had recently  not salty about it or anything    But just for the sake of using the thread properly  I made a stupid Hunter deck to mess around with because I got the Quest for it  and I have faced nothing but rogues

hunters because they dont draw a single CotW and theres games that are really close because they used two backtoback   Not sure why so many people are complaining about hunters  They have no healing  close to zero card draw and nonexistent comeback mechanics contrary to all the salt  slapping down CotW on a severely hopeless board as a hunter will NOT give you any chance of coming back  unless your opponent is retarded   But they are really strong when they get ahead  Theyre a very allornothing class  CotW is  in my opinion  very much a winmore card  This makes it seem unfair when the hunter is winning on board and plays it  because that could possibly seal the game for them  A hunters chance of winning any given game is greatly reduced if they never draw a CotW   I rarely have trouble against them  however   If you people are struggling against hunters  I recommend playing aggro decks  Hunters are good against control and bad against aggro in my experience\", \"commentId\":
