{\"comment\": \"Man you are wrong on so many levels  I have played both aggro and control and when you play aggro you just hope that you kill your opponent until late game because then you will get rekt by his legendaries  When you play aggro you just hope that your opponent dont put some strong taunt or you draw spell which delas exactly damage for lethal  You dont use your brain because all off your cards suposed to go only face and if you try trading with them on a board they are just so weak  And yes control needs some skill because you have to think what you opponent will play play around it and get board control\", \"commentId\": \"21193\", \"commentDate\": \"1465071682\"}, {\"comment\": \"Actually  Anubarak is pretty good P\", \"commentId\": \"21194\", \"commentDate\":
