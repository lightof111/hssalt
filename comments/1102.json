easy to get  That is not something to complain of  IMO Youre not salty about netdecking  which is essential  youre salty because people doesnt develop themselves  doesnt immerse themselves into the

12 legendaries  And decks like fatigue warrior  also extremely popular for some reason sloth imo are everything but cheap  Specially when there is plenty of cheaper decks that can perfectly do their job and be something fresh and interesting at the same time  I do not doubt most of people wont reach legend even netdecking the hot stuff they get from streamers  in fact legend is impossible to reach if you dont give plenty of time to this gamehave a godly win streak  But when you find exactly the same decks from rank 18 to legend  there is a problem  and its a human problem with the help of some blatant failures such as making a 4 mana 77 or allowing a class to give any minion charge and plenty of damage and attack buffs  And now adding things to salt found an interesting handlock deck  gave it a shot as it was my favorite warlock until molten giant nerf and TGT and LoE metas  First opponent  zoolock who goes full face mode  makes atrocious plays like playing Argus on 2 2health minions when I am about to Hellfire and wins because discovered Soulfire and didnt discarded the other Soulfire  And of course  said shitbag kept emoting the whole time  because why the hell not At least I could remember how it feels not fearing at all what will a NZoth priest steal from you because you are inmune to his 9000 board clears  overcome easily his ton of heals and you have more fatties than he can entomb or shadow word  Its been long since the last time I found a priest and didnt say anything like shit how will you fuck me this time\", \"commentId\": \"23012\",

because of RNG and he deleted me  After wards I played another brawl and I got super lucky and ran away with the game with a Loatheb into a 8 8 Edwin VanCleef into 5 5 Questing Adventurer  I never once BM the opponent since I understood this game was all RNG   Felt bad for the guy  all he played that game was a murloc and a raptor\", \"commentId\": \"23013\", \"commentDate\": \"1469205924\"},

because of the stale meta or anything like that  but because there is no fun when the only victories I get is against people that have only basic decks  Im not a good player  but Im decent enough to have reached Rank 15 consistently for over a year without really trying hard  I dont know whats wrong  but it doesnt feel like its me  I have noticed there is something wrong with the random draw  I usually draw whatever cards I mulligan first  Even when I only have one copy of it in the deck  Other cards almost never come up  Ive played when Undertaker was utterly broken  when Patron could kill you from 30 with an empty board  when Dr  Boom was in every deck  and I had fun and won through all of that  Im not getting bored  Im getting actively frustrated  My anticipation for the next expansion is already taking a hit because at this rate  I wont even be able to beat the AI\", \"commentId\": \"23017\", \"commentDate\": \"1469215308\"}, {\"comment\": \"Nah  its you\", \"commentId\":
