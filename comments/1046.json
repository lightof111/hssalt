one linebreak in your post so you clearly have an idea of how to split your sentences into paragraphs for increasing readability  Now you just need to do it more  As for your post I can tell youre a good person because you realized yourself you were being an asshole  Frustration can bring out the worst in the best of us so dont beat yourself down for it  But maybe next time remember this thread instead of adding opponents  And for my personal salt this morning    theres an algorithm that queues you up against classes you are weak to if your name is me  Ive played against one druid  one hunter and around 910 warriors today and warrior is my worst matchup  So I created a hunter to farm warriors  Gets queued up against zoo immediately  Cockmunching fucking suck nuggets  Next game is against warrior  great  Except I have CotW  Freezing trap and no early game against CW  I swear to god Ive played 4 hunter games this season before today and all of them I had 2x CotW and Highmanes in my starting hand  Always mulligan one and get the other for free or draw it on turn 1 along with some other bullshit   So I eventually get bored of midranged hunter  turns out its pretty slow having 8 costs and 6 cost cards to start out  Switched back to zoo for faster games  Gets queued up against warrior again  Starting hand reads 2x forbidden ritual  defender of argus  mortal coil   \",

aggro not including shaman  ofc but then I kept running into priests  Now  priest is shit  you might say  and that might be true in standard  but in wild Nzoth priest is incredibly effective  Especially so against mine  since they nearly always have the board clears to wipe my patrons  and big threats like Grom and Rafaam get obliterated  At one point I played this same bullshit deck 4 games in a row  and lost all of them  Fortunately  through the power of RNGsus I was able to rank up against a priest who drew none of billboard clears\", \"commentId\": \"21827\", \"commentDate\":

because we were both in fatigue  I made sure to bait his shield slams  executes and anything wich could be used to combo with Sylvanas  And I play a 3030 CThun as priest  Plays Acolyte of Pain and Brawl  Acolyte wins  of course  Emotes wow  But well  I am at max health and he is taking fatigue damage while dangerously close to lethal  so I keep waiting and hope his Golden Monkey gives him something crappy  Plays Golden Monkey with other 3 cards in the deck  Gets Reno Jackson    emotes wow  After wasting 20 minutes in a match that RNG decided to flop on the last second  I hit the
