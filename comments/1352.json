Ferryman  Starting to believe they live in another dimension  because Johnny  Timmy and the other guy rule all over the world  class identities you know  like rogues using weapons and weapon buffs matter and rogue has access to lots of powerful single target removal  while not needing any heal  taunt or defensive tool  Oh  and Blade Flurry being perfectly fine at 4 mana  Its surprising how  so far the only cards they directly buffed were Mage Frostbolt and Fireball used to cost 3 and 5 respectively and Hunter Unleashed the Hounds costed 4 mana before  As far as I can remember  only those  now wielded by some of the most cancerous and untouchable decks ever  But no  trying to save a class whose only reason to exist is a neutral card is not something to aim at  Fuck off  Team 5  You might do great art  cool lore and shit  but you dont seem to understand anything about that trivial things people call balance  class identity and viability\", \"commentId\": \"28347\",

you out  The deck definitely has weaknesses  The biggest weakness hunter has is that it has no card draw  so we sometimes have to hope and pray for good topdecks to win games  A lot of people who play the deck also dont play their secrets in a smart way  they just dump a bunch of them out once they get the huntress on the board  which is stupid  If a hunter drops a freeze trap in the early game and you send a 11 with a battlecry after him  thats a huge waste of that secret  and you get to hit your battlecry again  that actually works for you instead of against you  If you just want to be salty thats cool  but let me know if you want some advice about how the deck works  what deck youre running  etc  If you want you can add me and well play a few games so you can practice against the deck\",
