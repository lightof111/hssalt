version of it and NZoth priest you actually play minions and steal a lot less  Yeah  you can cheat a lot with darkmender  but still most of the time you are needing to actually play the game instead of sitting trusting them to do all the hard work  2 If even shamans and zoos can complain here  why not me Specially when Im complaining about everyday problems of every people like how did you get

trading Like this guy has a 2Health beast and havent used any beast synergy  lets ignore the beast wich I could kill without any effort and dominate  Its not they go face when its good  its they go

snowball to victory just by controlling a lil bit  you kill it  In fact  nowadays I almost only lose against control  and most of the times i because they ignore my board and then I turn the table  I
