this pack was a duplicatehttpi imgur comzw1vSm6 jpgUPDATE Just opened my first set of two packs for completing quests  I GOT 9 DUPLICATES OUT OF 10 CARDS I know there is a random mechanic to it  but this really seems silly and like we deserve compensation tooI opened 140 cards  of those 140 I only got 71 individual cards out of a 132 set\", \"commentId\": \"28694\", \"commentDate\":

taunt is not a problem for them  since they have charge and execute plus the never ending weapons   so  i guess ill have to put 2 oozes  and maybe 2 of new ones and one harrison jones to counter this

Pirate Warrior my first win wth the deck  6th match Secret Hunter  Tried other stuff for the pack quests  same shit  the only difference was a couple Zoolocks among the way  Its funny  I had nothing against Midrange Shaman or Secret Hunter until today  Not because of the decks themselves  but because people would rather spam the same decks they did before the expansion instead of trying new
