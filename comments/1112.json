bullshit for a 4drop  Players shouldnt have to dump 34 cards andor minion trades to take down a 4 drop  The only ones who dont have to worry about that are Warriors because they are graced with goddamn 1mana hard removal and Warlock who is equally graced with 1mana removal in the form of Power Overwhelming  It doesnt make a 477 less OP  it just means Warlock and Warrior have equally bullshit cards to counter it  Sap and Freezing trap are also close runners up while we are talking about unfair cards    Not unfair because they are too good  but unfair in the respect that they are poorly designed  Cards like SapFreezing are bullshit because they EXCLUSIVELY punish players for trying to play decks that arent aggrovomit  and rewards players who do play aggro vomit  SapFreeze someones big minion Congratz you just won the game  SapFreeze vs Zoolock or some other fast deck Lol congratz you have a worthless card and will probably lose the game  This is why its not rewarding to even play strategic decks or decks that revolve around defensive strategy  why bother when 1 sapfreezing will virtually wreak everything your trying to do  but that same player can just BREEZE though easy as fucking pie with a spam deck like Zoolock  Tempo Mage or Midrange Hunter  Oh but I forget  theres always Tank fucking Warrior there to removal everything for 1mana or clear all your early game with Win Axe and then put on ridiculous amounts of armour until they just burn you to death via fatigue  SO MUCH STRATEGY GOING ON THERE  OH HOW DO THEY MANAGE ALL THE THINKING INVOLVED  So yeah\",

general decks in the meta  But I also dislike it because regardless of skill requirement  I am saddened to see OTK decks are STILL a prevalent thing even though the community has repeatedly asked Blizzard to stop allowing that OTK bullshit  How many times have we been over this simpleass concept  cards that give unrestricted CHARGE are a BAD IDEA Im not even going to pull up that speech Blizzard gave when they nerfed Leeroy and then Warsong and then FoN and then Arcane Golem and then Blade Flurry for this same fucking thing to happen yet again  Once again  they need to go BACK to the design room and give a stern look at any card that allows unreasonable burst damage from an empty board to happen  This game does not allow instants  it doesnt have good taunts with Blecher gone and it doesnt even have a single card that actually hard counters the charge mechanic  There are counter cards to every mechanic in this game  from taunt to 7 atk to 2 atk to divine shield  weapon breakers  having 4 minions etc etc etc but there STILL has never ever been a card printed that says when a CHARGE minion is played  X thing happens  Why Blizzard Why is it that you love charge so much  and refuse print a card that fucks up the day of the person who plays one against you  Why What the fuck  this is the 5th or 6th time youve allowed a OTK deck to become top tier and going to keep happening until you knock this shit off    and you know what the BIGGEST fuck you part about OTK decks is Its that ONCE AGAIN  it encourages players to not bother with control decksdefensive decks and instead just play aggrospam or fast decks that end the game so early that the OTK isnt possible because the game ended too fast  The OTK deck rewards you for playing the cheesy noobfriendly decks and punishes you for trying to play a defensiveslow deck that actually has some strategy to it  Because if youre playing a control deck all thats going to happen is  the Warrior does nothing but draw cards for several turns  then just kills you outright once they have all 5 pieces of Exodia in their hand\", \"commentId\": \"23226\", \"commentDate\": \"1469603802\"}, {\"comment\": \"Literally

losing fairly frequently at that rank  which  if this game was any fair  would mean these people are just as good as me    On a side note  that game was absolute trash  Like  they froze my board for 4 consecutive turns  That I think were actually 5 because of a Cabalists tome   only went face with their only minion at the board at that time  and drew like crazy for no apparent reason  I was watching my life go down 4 HP at a time  Their 3 attack minion  Ping  every turn  because of course  why make use of those freezes to clear my barely alive minions with your HP    with an Ice Block up  Reno in hand  5 cards more in my deck than my opponent  actually wasting cards because I had to play them not to burn my draws because of Ysera that stuck for 5 turns on the board  I think my opponents strategy was boring me to death  I was in no danger the entire freaking game  When my opponent played their Antonidas  I had 3 ways to kill it without breaking a sweat  I felt so little threat that I actually didnt bother killing the minion that hammered my face for 3 turns  simply making sure I didnt overdraw and kept my gameplan of outvaluing them into fatigue going since they drew
