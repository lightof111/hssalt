"[{\"comment\": \"No offense mate  Im not one to talk when Im also commenting here like every second day due to my pure unluck and salt  but if you cant even win some games with aggro shaman  then you should just quit   You have problems with every class  you have problems with every deck  trust me I know what unluck is  I also had friends spectating and saying this is literally impossible and I also kept statistics which showed that the RNG happening to me is almost statistically impossible  but what you are doing is way above releasing saltiness at this point  Fun fact  as Im writing this playing my new yoggn load  my own Yogg just killed me from 16 hp without fatigue  This happens  to you and me a lot more than to others  But if you are stuck around rank 15 for such a long time  then probably your plays arent as good as you think they are  And no  I dont want to spectate you  I know the feel when you cant win a 5050 for hours  But even when I couldnt win a single RNG moment for a month  I still ended up rank 4  because at least I didnt misplay like my opponents  Yes  aggro is disgusting  limits deckbuilding  takes away every fun aspect of the game and you can do nothing about it  But if that makes you post here every 15 minutes  just dont play it  its really no worth it\", \"commentId\": \"24014\", \"commentDate\": \"1471005597\"}, {\"comment\": \"Which one is the 1 mana

morning   It just that I lost the first two or three in a row  resulting in the salt post you see    We probably have different reasons for playing  but my reason now is to piss off as many players as possible   So  here we go with aggro shaman\", \"commentId\": \"24016\", \"commentDate\": \"1471008246\"}, {\"comment\": \"Execute   Warrior has a million ways to deal 1 damage for almost no

losing a lot in Ranked  just take a break  go play some Brawls or something and come back later or another day   and also  changing too many decks is counterproductive  youll be better of playing a few and mastering them to the most of your ability  Or just play anything you want  but not for ranks and youll feel much better about the game \", \"commentId\": \"24022\", \"commentDate\":

Magic enough though  and no long interested in it because of outdated mechanics  and spending hundreds to play  But as for the games Im thinking of Duelyst  Elder Scrolls Legends  Eternal  Hearthstone  all aggrotempo decks are king  and control is tier 3 at best   Faeria Im unsure of  but aggro seems to be really strong there as well  I want to play a control meta because thats when player interaction is at the highest  when every move matters  and the most thought is put into what your opponent has on board and hand over the course of a game  Not the current 6 turn perfect curve I win  you had no answers or they just lose because I had a perfect starting hand and they ran out of gas  its not interesting at all  thats not interaction\", \"commentId\": \"24033\", \"commentDate\":
