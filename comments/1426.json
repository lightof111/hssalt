"[{\"comment\": \"So the last 810 games as pirate warrior and I have not drawn a single weapon after 15 cards not including mulligans   I am literally losing the game because I do not get a single weapon   I am not even getting fucking upgrades for the shitty 13 There are 8 fucking cards that I can draw to help me out but nope  HS says I must not get weapons\", \"commentId\": \"29897\",

PriestHunterplayer  i feel like i cant do anything against any of these decks  I literally die at Turn 45 without even playing one minion  or be able to stabilize MetaDecks nowadays are always so annoying to handle  My Grudge builds up a long time now and after i found this topic  i guessed its time to release some steam from my engines Rogue  Dont do anything  Stealth is up with Conceal  draws 56 Cards  each turn and burst you for 20 HP  Cool  Sap your shit  Fine  Malygos and then start spamming greetings  Okay if thats the way you want to play  sure Druid  BeastTokenAggroDruid to the MalygosDruid and JadeGolems  Literally clears the board and starts spamming Golems  I only have two ShadowWordDeaths    Shaman  Dont get me started on Shaman  Every  Shaman  I  Saw  LITERALLY  EVERYONE was playing a FaceHunterish  SpellDamage  GolemDeck  And even if you could have fought back with your Sylvanas  Highmanes  Darkonids  No Hex  Fun Warrior  We all have these games  Turn one  Hook  Patches  11  Turn two  Upgrade into HAHA Your health is now 21 at turn 2  It sucks to play against them and makes me wonder  why exactly did Ben Brode and his team nerf Face Hunter Oh yes  The same reason FaceWarrior is so strong at the moment  Little to no counterplay possible  Taunts Nah  6 DMG Arcanite Reaper  Mortal Strike and Finnley for Steady Shot  And the complete Opposite is Control  Try to fight someone with more Removal than Priest and 60 HP  You cant Guessed so Priest  Dragons  Dragons everywhere  i mean RenoPriest is fine  but youre dead till turn 6  You have NO AoEDmg before turn 456  and you HAVE to draw it  if not the BMing Pirate Warrior is going to win Drakonid OP and other cards like Potion are soo good But not fast enough in this meta  I mean look at Entomb  Youre not playing it anymore since its too slow Paladin  Sigh  Not much to say  Buff your hand and drop that 43 Selfless Hero  33 Argent Squire and the Doppelgangster with 55  I dont have that much removal anyway Hunter  I dont see many hunters anymore  And when i see them  are they in extreme christmanseasonfeeling  Your get turn 3 4 Secrets  And you get secrets EVERYBODY GETS A SECRET  By the time you tested every possible Secret  he KCd your Face for this win Mage  Nothing much to say  You get more than 20 DMG just in Burn Spells  2 Fireballs 12  2 Torches 18  2 Frostbolt 6     Withh Apprentiance and Flamewalker youll die way earlier  Or the i cant die secret  Or the SilenceRemoval  Or the best legendary for a class to generate more BURNDmg  Warlock  Were gonna be rich or Get it out  Get it out  You have no chance of comeback either way once they cleared your board  One is controlling the game and the other controls the board The Community  W H Y do you guys need to BM each other People are so unfriendly nowadays  Adding you after a game and telling you  that you suck  Or telling you that you got outskilled  Thats why we probably need a AutoSquelchButton for some people  It is so unnecessary and annoying to play with kids  who believe that going face and winning at turn 4 needs Skill Professionals  Even players like Noxious  who i known for his fun and unconventional Decks in HS  turned their back  because even they said  that Hearthstone is turning into a more and more aggressive Game  Trump asked a couple of days ago how to beat Pirate Warrior  since he had no idea either  Let me say it like the kazookid  I LIKE TO DANCE  PRETEEEEND AND I LIKE TO HAVE FUN And not die at Turn 4 \", \"commentId\": \"29898\", \"commentDate\": \"1482322448\"}, {\"comment\":

playtest the new set beforehand and builded a pirate deck  He absolutly destroyed anyone and anything with it in multiple games at blizzard Then he asked Whats the counter to it and Blizzard responded There is no counter When i have read this  i immeditaly understood that blizzard is fully aware what they have done and they are total ok  with Small Time Bucaneer and Patches as a hole  because the knowingly released it that way  I will laugh my ass off if they nerf one of those cards  because more hypocritical isnt possible  First they release cards they fully understand are OP to its core and then they nerf it No way  I consider to really leave this game if they nerf those cards  because thats just so wrong in so many ways  Dont get me wrong  i think STB is a busted card and does simply too much for a 1 drop  so it would deserve a nerf  but in the same time a nerf would tell me that blizzard does this intentionally to force a specific meta\", \"commentId\": \"29906\",
