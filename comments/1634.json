deck under control was aggro  but the new expansion will punish aggro decks  which is perfectly fine btw  i just fear it could be the rise of Jade Druid   hopefully i m wrong on this one  Last chance

\"Currently am 22  But those initial 2 losses immediately caught me off guard  It may not be the perfect deck and I need to pilot it correctly to make wins  But I am very self critical and observed every move I and my opponent made to make the most of the situation   But against those 2 losses I felt completely powerless  The hunter got double Call of the Wild after I dropped Reno and proceeded to ignore any board action  The paladin was a normal start but eventually got double divine shield guy twice in a row  Grimestreet Protector to keep HanCho save and clear my board  In the meantime all my removal was nowhere to be found even though I smart managed my card pool in the mulligan  Sometimes this game can be pretty damn confusing and frustrating\", \"commentId\": \"34319\",

currently am 32 so  a bit more luck  But the fact that he managed to buff a minion even before HanCho and copy it with faceless shambler was a wtf moment  Like sometimes the RNG in games can be so messed up that even a decently put together deck fails hard against it    But I have to say guys  the thread totally works  I somehow do feel better about the fact that shit just happens sometimes  No matter the effort you put in arena  arena decks  RNG  can still come around and take you from behind sometimes but thats fine I guess  So once again thanks for understanding D  Currently 32 but taking

mechanics and Jades was just laziness these decks arent particularly fun  very low skill level and just generally bad mechanics for a game like HS  It takes the skill and thought in deckbuilding and decision making out of the window and instead makes it all about how lucky your mulligan and top decks are  To make it worse they are the stuff that will be predominately around with the new expansion since many interesting and cool cards are off to wild  Not really sure how one expansion will solve this\", \"commentId\": \"34327\", \"commentDate\": \"1490794318\"}]"
