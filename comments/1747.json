Spikeridged steed is a completely insane card I genuinely want to discuss this card with people but know that if I start a thread someone will link me back here   Back to the card it costs 1 mana more

way past this guy    Naturally its vulnerable to transform but what isnt   To be honest Im glad paladin got some new toys  god knows he needed them  Im just surprised noone seems to be talking about
