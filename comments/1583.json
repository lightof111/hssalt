"[{\"comment\": \"Hats off to you pirate warrior that just won in 5 turns  You must be a wonderful player  spamming emotes every minute of the short lasting game  Sure an amazing curve and rng made your broken brainless deck win in 5 turns  I hope you had so much fun in those few minutes spamming emotes considering your superiority for that clever deck  Bah  Came back after a few weeks not playing trying to save some gold for the new expansion in casual  CASUAL  But sure still nothing else than pirate warriors  jade shamans and jade druids in CASUAL\", \"commentId\": \"33250\",

15 today after I counted 87 matches  So no  you are not the most unlucky in HS  but I can relate to your feelings right now  Its what I say to myself after every loss  but I also realise that there are tons of people who have the same issues  Its just a RNG game and people who are unlucky just notice it more  Its easy to say you have skill when your card draw is amazing and you have every answer in your hands  Skill is a part of the game obviously  but luck is an even bigger aspect of the game  Im sorry that youre one of the people who lacks the luck\", \"commentId\": \"33255\",

be 2 Kun the Forgotten Kings  letting him play 20 mana value out in a single turn and so of course I lost  WTF  Then the second game I lost because my opponent had a random demon played onto the board
