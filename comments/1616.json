about Ozruk  I agree though  people can be too harsh towards cards revealed first when we dont know the rest of the expansion and possible synergies  Hell  maybe well see a card that makes your minion permanently untargetable by spells and Ozruk does see play  Maybe there will be a crusherconcede deck that aims to exhaust all of your opponents removal and then play him  Unlikely  since jades will remain  but who knows\", \"commentId\": \"33937\", \"commentDate\": \"1490099794\"}, {\"comment\": \"Its like there is a invisible wall between rank 6 and 5  Now back to r6 with 2 stars from 5

you just said you didnt care it was a cancer deck  Most of the people in the salt thread have been upset at the amount of aggro damage you can push using that deck before your opponent can even react  Im actually quite happy you got hard countered so bad  because theres nothing worse than losing to a pirate warrior when they push damage faster than you can even play the game  Im not saying you cant feel salty on a salt thread  but no ones going to sympathize with you\", \"commentId\": \"33946\", \"commentDate\": \"1490108967\"}, {\"comment\": \"3 wins in a row to rank 5 with midrange shami
