"[{\"comment\": \"Even worse  the netdeckers seem to emote spam and BM 10 times worse when they get the upper hand over an original deck  So many times I play an extended match against a brain dead netdeck like face Shaman  Zoo  or a boring as shit Justicar warrior  using an original deck and the cowards I face are silent until the moment they think the match has turned in their favour and all of a sudden its sarcastic emotes    I mean  really  I knew you werent worthy of respect just because of the deck you were playing  but did you have to prove you actually deserved disrespect too newsflash  the rank you get to playing face shaman or zoo or whatever deck you copy from the frontpage of hearthpwn wins you NO credibility as a player  none  bots can get legend with face Shaman  so you SUCK if youre not there yet\", \"commentId\": \"21757\", \"commentDate\": \"1466329058\"}, {\"comment\": \"Word  But dark iron dwarf really isnt that unusual in a zoo  just not an aggro zoo which

becomes very frustrating only if you take it seriously  Just whooped a Mages ass up and down  playing a control style Shaman deck extremely well  I completely had the game in the bag and honestly without ego I can say I did outplay him  Whats he do    plays Yogg  of course he should be dead because he was stupid enough to wait until he had no card in his deck  so he should be dying by fatigue  but no  because its fucking Yogg Saron    Uses gangup to fill his deck with 3 more Yoggs and get this THREE fucking torches  and     of course clears my board  deals all the dmg he needs to my face     he lived with 2hp aftering drawing an insane amount of cards    did I mention at one point Yogg healed him for fucking 16 heal Why did we even need to play that game  might as well start with a coin flip to decide the winner and move on  It was nothing but a 30 minute waste of time  Then the cunt has the balls to friend me after like hur dur  I think maybe I should have lost but a I got so lucky

Ive started to rope all day long against all shaman players  if I encounter flame juggler or argent squire during my first turns  Youre not getting fast games against me  Its just so fucking frustrating to die at turn 5 against a player who gives a shit about trading and would get punished so hard if I just had any better luck with my cards  Mysteriously every time I face this cancer  all my answers are in the bottom of my deck  I cant fully blame the players about that unbalanced shit hurrdurr snowballing troggs and doomhammer  facebiter but damn  people have to be very desperate getting some length to their virtual penises  This game has so much potential to be fun  and sometimes it even is  when you really have to think about the consequences of every play and plan several turns ahead in some longer control matchups  Sadly thats quite rare nowadays since you get annihilated in matter of seconds and my role in most of the games is just to pray that some rapist would ravage the butthole of the opposing megofacekid  Edit I promise that this is my rant about aggrocancer  Edit2 The roping seems to work  Ive got 2 free wins because those ADHDkids dont have the patience to play games that last longer than 30 seconds\", \"commentId\": \"21762\", \"commentDate\": \"1466345592\"}, {\"comment\": \"Lol  playing shaman you dont have even right to complain  cause
