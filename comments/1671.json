fucking mage     I love mage  I played it a lot but wtf is this they freeze every turn your board and when they drew there whole deck they finish you  You cant do anything against it   They need to nerf this class just like the they need to nerf the rogue quest  Fucking playing against a mage is so annoying you cant do anything  Just watch him play and you can look at your frozen minions

game  not even at rank 20  i tried standard  wild  all deck types  you get lose after lose after lose and its inexplicable and drives me insane  I play proven decks that i get decent win rates and still cant win  I just tried midrage shaman  i got 23 cards of 3 or less cost and 7 card of 4 or more  Game after game i mulligan ALL cards and i still cant play anything before turn 4  those 7 cards

they move rag to hall of fame just to permanently give his power to Warrior The fuck  the RnG completely decides games whether or not that 8 damage hits a 11  a giant minion  or face  Terrible design

priest  He casually plays 1212 plant on turn 3 with no respect to Aldor  which of course i dont have  Am i in some kind of only play against highrollers pool I think if you evaluate probabilities of

minion to their hand  then the rest the deck is just the most random combination of 1 drop cards that they would normally never play  It shouldve been play X cards from your opponents class or play X cards that cost 1 or less mana  something that wouldnt completely change the archtype  Even play X minions with stealth wouldve been better than this bullshit\", \"commentId\": \"35083\",
