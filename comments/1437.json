"[{\"comment\": \"If you cant figure out why people play aggro decks then you are as dumb as the people that fail an iq test because its really easy to understand  Aggro decks are easy to play  They are also incredibly strong  Aggro decks are CHEAP  Meaning they dont require your deck to be half legendaries see control warrior deck lists  Aggro decks dont take 30 min per game and can therefore rank up on ladder faster  Of course they are annoying as hell to play against over and over again especially if you cant counter them well but the reasoning as to WHY people play aggro decks Its pretty simple  Wish people would stop asking why aggro decks exist   they dont have any comprehension of balance in a card game  AGGRO AND CONTROL MUST COEXIST ALWAYS\", \"commentId\": \"30126\",

make an excuse for the existence of aggro decks  Thats just how it is  Im glad that there are still people on this site that understand how the game actually works\", \"commentId\": \"30130\",

56 for one  But you need to get that because   you cant block  So minions go face  So any turn you cant clear  you instantly die  Not only do you need AoE to live  but you need UNFAIR AoE and you need it RIGHT NOW  So this leads to a spiral of frustration for everyone where the aggressive player has to play into AoE that is always unfair to them if they have it All this because   you cant block So you cant react as the reacting player  All you can do is AoE  or die\", \"commentId\": \"30138\", \"commentDate\": \"1482862092\"}, {\"comment\": \"Seriously think about it 90 of the minions in the game right now do one of two things1 Have a battlecry that gives value  so basically    theyre spells 2 Are overstated and used aggressively to go face  so   basically   spells Rarely do you use a minion to trade into one minion one turn  then another minion a turn later  Usually they just trade 1 for 1 into each other anyway But what you want to do is just clear the board if youre control and go face if youre aggressive  Whats the point of a minion nowThe only minion deck is Dragon Priest  Every other deck is an AoE deck or a face deck\", \"commentId\": \"30139\", \"commentDate\":

make my own control decks and none of them can beat Jade Druid  then I get frustrated and play some games with Aggro  Im sure Im wrong but late game control decks sure seem like an autolose to Jade Druid   Personally  if I dont get some good tempo with Shaman  Pally or Hunter  OR play strait Aggro I get crushed  Ive basically stopped playing Priest as an entire class  Control Warrior  Reno

is on the faster side but its not like control decks cant win  Look at all the best players in hs and tell me how many are trying to reach rank 1 with aggro decks\", \"commentId\": \"30142\",
