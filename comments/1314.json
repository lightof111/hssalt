just useful piece of advice to new players it would be this Never play on a mobile phone  except for the most casual kind of stuff like tavern brawl  You cannot maintain the same sort of quality with your plays and you expose yourself to the massively tilting experience of disconnects  You dont even have to lose signal  sometimes you just get random shitty disconnects from the server even though your phone is telling you that you have full 4g   Nothing is more soul destroying than losing to shaman with priest due to a disconnect even though you stabilised   Also the trains in my computer arent content with bring totally shit and never on time they also stop randomly in the tunnel before my stop where there is so signal  just to piss me off no doubt\", \"commentId\": \"27570\",
