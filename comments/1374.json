around 70 packs and I was earning money for them for about 2 months reason why I didnt bought all ONK wings and I got only 1 legendary  5 epics and bunch of useless rares and commons and duplicates  I got 21 duplicates of warlock card I think Abyssal Enforcer is what it is called which is about 100 dust didnt even got golden one and two of epics was that pig that gains charge in some conditions  And on top of that the legendary one was auction master beardo which barely cannot be used without Raza  One really important thing is that Im in Europe and there is not triclass and bunch of duplicates bug involved  While there are people getting two legendaries in pack and one of them is golden and is good one I am here collecting the dust to create one legendary that I need  Not to mention that Europe is always getting all the things after Americas  It is like all the luck is concetrated on 10 of players and all other players are getting almost nothing and I dont think HS is f2p game because you need to spend for like 200300 to get cards you need and craft the others  I just cant believe that for 70 packs you get almost nothing\", \"commentId\": \"28805\", \"commentDate\":

pass  he plays Cogmaster Turn 2 I play topdecked Fiery Bat somehow missed all my 8 2drops and 6 1drops except from that bat  he plays Mechwarper  Coin and AnnoyoTron  Turn 3 I play Zipgunner  Opponent plays Gorillabot and rams my face  Turn 4 I play something else and kill the taunt  opponent plays Fel Reaver discovered and crushes my face again  Turn 5 I play Doppelgangster and kill Mechwarper and

soon enough that this tome gave him 2 more Cabalists Tome  and a Polymorph  which sets the tone for the rest of the match  I play my White Eyes  and manage to get an Ancestral Spirit on it  He of course Polymorphs it  The game goes on  and I get a lucky Aya pull from my Barnes      which he then Polymorphs  The game continues  him having cute little answers to nearly everything I play  until I finally have a decent board with some Jade Golems  Cue the Kazakus Potion      with a builtin Polymorph  just for fun  Later still  my board is clear  he Firelands Portals my face and gets a White Eyes  I play my Sylvanas and Lava Burst it  stealing the White Eyes  Polymorph  I eventually get a small board and draw my Aya Blackpaw  Thinking he must be out of steam by now  I play her  and tack on an Ancestral Spirit  Then this guy  this GUY  having no board otherwise  throws out the Cabalists Tome  and gets the freaking Polymorph  We eventually draw the last cards in our decks  He has some minions  and I dont  I play my freaking NZoth keeping in mind I had essentially played 2 White Eyes and 2 Aya  get back my one Sylvanas Windrunner  and wait for the match to end               Polymorph I concede  And if youre wondering why the above clown fiesta is in quotes  its because         I was the Reno Mage in question  I dont think Id ever gotten luckier in any game Ive ever played  but it just didnt seem right posting this in the pepper thread  so Im posting it the salt thread on this guys behalf  I tried adding him afterward  since I thought his deck was really cool
