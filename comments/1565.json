"[{\"comment\": \"Was just watching a streamer at rank 5 wild  facing a pirate warrior  There is one type of decision in pirate warrior you can argue requires a functioning brain  trading or going face which is still tutorial level  and yet the pirate warrior somehow managed to make the wrong call every turn  He probably wouldve done better if he straight up flipped a coin on whether to go face or trade  Fortunately the warrior lost  but he definitely wouldnt have if he hadnt played completely horribly\", \"commentId\": \"32864\", \"commentDate\": \"1488147348\"}, {\"comment\": \"i always

Came back eventually to collect on quests  farm tavern brawl pack  Decide to give an arena run a go  Given 9 total 4 mana cost minion choices  several of which are terrible  6 of which were before the 10th card in the draft  so I ignored those  Panic rising as I reach card 24 without being given the option for a 2 or 1 drop  Curve ends TERRIBLY  2 one drops  2 two drops  1 3 drop  Highlight of the draft  Pick between Clockwork Giant  Weasel Tunneler  and Dirty Rat  Whatever  at least I picked up a couple board clears  right Start the first match  draw surprisingly good curve against shaman  They play one turn 1 minion  and then answer every single minion I play until turn 6  where they finally play their second minion  They totem roll every turn  each being the relevant one at the time  taunt totem to block good trade against his one drop  allowing him to secure a good trade with it elsewhere  spell damage before spells and to buff his spirit claws  of course  the 11 after my board was cleared  and the healing totem when he got to turn 8 and I could only trade my two minions in perfectly for the health of his other minion  so on and so forth  So  play nothing for 5 turns besides weapons and spells  and then follow up with Sunwalker  Fire Elemental  and a 2 cost thing from below  by which time Ive already run out of cards that I can play that wont just be wiped out  Concede  I mean  christ  I can take losing but Ive been straight shut out of games for weeks  I dont know if I can work up the spirit to keep going anymore  Sigh\", \"commentId\": \"32875\", \"commentDate\":

{\"comment\": \"This shitty meta is getting on my nerves  I hate playing as Pirate Warrior  Jade Druid bores me to death   I already have a gold Shaman so I dont want to waste time going back to that and Mage Reno is the same shit every single time  I know if I sit here and play PW nonstop Ill rank up more but its so   fucking   dull  Its almost as if this game wants to punish you for having fun  God forbid anyone crafts their own shit and ranks with it  Nope  cant have that because we get broken shit that puts a select few cards over the many  Every single Mage I have come across in Standard has been Reno  Every single Druid and Shaman is Jade  Every single fucking one of them  Having a card which pretty much negates the penalty of having Reno is stupid  Having a card that costs one mana which can snowball into a row of infinite colossal minions is stupid  Having a 13 weapon  two 11s and with coin  a 32 on turn one is stupid  Shit  even without STB youre already stupid with the first two  It can drive you insane thinking about how bad this is\", \"commentId\": \"32879\", \"commentDate\": \"1488179120\"}, {\"comment\": \"Cant stress this enough     This dull an boring as FUCK

sitting at a 50  winrate 4444 at rank 14 where I just had a 6 game losing streak  and I have played more this season than I normally do  Last season I had a 65  winrate 5823  Last week I had a 12 games lose streak   The major difference RNG  I dont mind it  You give some and you take some but this season    I get punished when I try to test my RNG and its like my opponent gets rewarded everytime  Kazakus used to be my MVP and this time    Well    Give your nonexisisting minions some health  draw some cards you dont need or take some armor  You dont need to revive those bastards or clear the board anyway  And when I finally revive I get a sheep thx Polymorph and a couple of 11 minions that came from my Imp gang boss   And normally I have a pretty good take on shamans and warriors e g  1511 and 114 last season  respectively  This season Well 1013 and 37   It is starting to get to me\", \"commentId\": \"32881\", \"commentDate\": \"1488184103\"}, {\"comment\": \"Sadly  I need to agree on this  After yet another break from HS  I played again a bit last week  Never found the game so boring and unbalanced as it is now  Extremely limited variation in decks 90 of opponents are pirate warrior  shammy of golem druids  Golems are way to difficult to deal with  only very certain decks rush decks can beat them  Game is even more rockpaperscissors than ever  Influence of
