standard right  but at what rank is that lamsednav interested cause it bears relevance to the BM like they just played a massive skill turn Much agreed whether you are Kripp or some scum  if there is really a skilful play then both winner and loser ought to just be amazed and see it play out with interest    but if just something nasty fate plays out  its not that weird if the loser is pissed  and the winner would be pathetic to do an undeserved victory lap  Similar to trolling  if its mastered some respect is due Ive been a moderator for years and I still judge by merits  not out of some role but if youre just being an asshole  thats a whole different story  Partially subjective  Complex like humor can be    Disco lock doesnt seem that unskilful to me by the way  there are micro and macro decisions to be made there    I agree about the other ones though  Discolock is rather fresh as real success so dont expect the counters to be so welldeveloped either\", \"commentId\": \"25974\",

board  and put something on his side of the board  In all 3 games I had lethal next turn and there was no card combination that could prevent that lethal until that ridiculous card got played and completely destroyed me  The last one was the most ridiculous one of all  I had YShaarj  Bog Creeper and Rag on my side of the table and my opponent had 0 cards in hand and was at 6 life  He topdecks Yogg  plays it  he casts DOOM  clears my board  draws 4 cards  puts 3 mage secrets and 1 hunter secret in play  casts Karakazham  Cabalists Tome and 2 Light in Darkness  Seriously  fuck Yogg\",

bullshit comes now from emote spamming kids mostly shamans and Yogg clownfiestas  But Im going to make you happy  I had some days ago an arena run with shaman  Got a pretty crappy midrange deck with only two big drops  Stormwind Champion and Eldritch Horror  Faced at 31 a mage  And here comes the shit  I first get Explosive Sheepd on my board  Then I get Cone of Cold two times in a row  I kept putting pressure  Cult Apothecary to keep Health high  Play around Flamestrike  Flamestrike happens  Then  with Flamestrike out  I start playing some more minions  Then mage plays Anomalus  Im like What the     but keep head calm and carry on  Mage kills the Anomalus    and plays another one So my board is wiped out again at the very moment I make it  Since then  got 8 turns of if I draw either Stormwind Champion or Eldritch Horror I win  Guess what I always drew some shitty minion  so that fucker always managed to avoid getting raced down  Finally  28th card in my deck comes  yay  its the Stormwind Champion Too bad I already lost all my board and I had to concede  Btw  Eldritch Horror was the 30th card  Oh  and of course  opponent played two Spellslinger  wich gave him Lay on Hands AND Healing Touch  avoiding lethal both of the times\", \"commentId\": \"25982\", \"commentDate\": \"1474039453\"}, {\"comment\": \"I want to know why Blizzard patched the Shaman Hero Power to read Summon
