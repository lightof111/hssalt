{\"comment\": \"Was so disgusted today I uninstalled  Was at ten health  Two auctioneer out  Have a discounted shiv evis malygos and prep in hand  So opponent is very dead next turn Just from spell dmg  His health was under ten  My opponent has a violet teacher out  His turn he attacks and then yoggs  First spell is doom  Then arcane missles  A bunch of stuff that has no targets  Druid spell that gives two attack  So he needs two more dmg for lethal  Yogg plays a prep  He then savage roars and kills me  Of course similar things have happened before  But I think I realized this time that this isnt the game I want to play  Here I am vying for board  Saving my combo pieces  Thinking about whats left in my deck and what my opponent may have  I mean if he had killed me with double swipe  well played  I wasnt aggressive enough and didnt make him use his swipes  If it was leeroy then gg  didnt see that coming  I shoulda played the chillmaw in my hand instead of drawing  Ive lost to both those senerios many times and never felt like this  But losing to yogg is just gross  The druid didnt have to think about saving his spells  Jusy use them whenever because they add up to some insane combo that noone can predict or play around  I think Im finally done wasting my time on this game other than this post because its not even remotely decided by choices anymore  Its all up to rngesus  And to me  thats no fun\", \"commentId\": \"23471\", \"commentDate\": \"1470066731\"}, {\"comment\": \"I realized this a month ago    And now Im a better person D  I just enjoy this forum even though
