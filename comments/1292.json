getting 12 wins in Arena  since the difference in quality between decks will be smaller  But consider this Multiple streamers have publicly completed the 100 in 10 Arena Challenge  If there are people that can average 10 wins in Arena across that many runs  than 12 wins in Heroic Brawl is hard  but achievable  In fact  I think we can expect to see one pro player or streamer get 12 wins in the first
