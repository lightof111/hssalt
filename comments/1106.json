"[{\"comment\": \"I have two complains  First of all  holy crap  the RNG in this game is becoming really absurd  Especially in standard ladder  its becoming really hard trying to win a game on pure skill  both because aggro makes all matchups draw dependant  and because stuff like Tuskarr Totemic and Yogg Saron exist  Now even control matchups are a pure RNG fiesta where the losing player can drop a 10 mana minion that can flip the entire outcome of the game  I mean  I should expect this from a Ben Brodes game  but now is becoming really crazy  Second  I hope Priest will stay the fucking garbage it is forever  because playing a control match against them is real bullshit  They literally play with your own decks  because most of the builds are running 2 thoughtsteal  2 shifting shades  2 entombs  and you are fighting against your own shit  Losing turn 5 to aggro decks is what they deserve until this lame gimmick will go away\", \"commentId\": \"23086\", \"commentDate\":

\"commentDate\": \"1469380108\"}, {\"comment\": \"My experiment today shows that even retarded offspring of humanapefishfrog can win in this game if it pilots an above aberage Tier 1 5 deck  So Its almost end of the season and I didnt care a lot about Hearthstone  I found myself today on rank 16  Instead of using a decent Dragon Warrior to grind my way to rank 5  I decided to conduct an experiment  So I found whats the least facoured class which is Priest  Then I build a NZoth total control list which list I intend to upload soon  I built it cautiously around the meta and I even decided to gimmick it a little bit with Shadow Word Horror   I ran a deck with pretty low winrate against the vermins of Hearthstone that cant get past rank 15 and strive to survive in the low ranks of Hearthstone playing though Tier 1 or 1 5 decks surprisingly  How could someone playing a ShamanHunterTempo MageDragon Warrior cant get past these ranks Even worse how can they all lose against Control Priest Results I got straight to rank 1312 without losing  Shamans got their asses handed to them Warriors conceded Mages Threatened and Hunters Conceded as well  Then I get to rank 13 to 12  I face another Hunter  Now this is the kind of humanapefishfrog I am talking about  He had a decent opening with good drops each turn  But he never played around anything so he started losing  He never cared about my Doomsayers or board clears  He even managed to produce value to my Shadow Word Horror  But because this is skillstone and Hunter is Hunter and face is the place I happen to be low on Health even when I spent 2 Flash Heals on me  So I have 7 Health and just got Justicar out  He proceeds his turn by playing Elek  Out of all his minions it gives him Tundra Rhino and I get a Shade so I guess game over  NOPE  He HPs me and passes the turn  I try to comprehend what happened there  He missed lethal really hard  Its like missing a shot on an empty goalpost  Its like youre holding a basketball and a crane places you above the basket and all you have to do is command your hands to release the ball and its in but somehow you fail it  In other words  rertarded fishfrog  I trade and try to survive next turn  He plays another Tundra Rhino and decides to HP instead ofdropping them both  I clear again and cant believe my luck  Topdeck to topdeck he missed lethal for more than 3 turns  Luckily for him he drew Call of the Wild and unlucky me I didnt draw Darkshire Alchemist  Wwll thats life  I guess somewhere in California right now theres a group of scientists that created an account and let a retarded fishfrog play Midrange Hunter and they are laughing at me  Oh well  thats Hearthstone ladies and gentlemen  Where being retarded doesnt matter\", \"commentId\": \"23089\",

annoying  I understand playing Yogg is a gamble but losing a 20minute match youre very close to winning just because Yogg removes your board and gives your opponent a bunch of secrets is just no fun at all  I was up against a Yogg Druid as a Demonlock Wild Ranked and only won that game by a hair after Yogg was played  With only four cards left I had to take a gamble and play Doomguard  He discarded all except the one card I was able to win the game with  Demonheart None of the secrets in the end prevented my opponent from losing but that was one close game\", \"commentId\": \"23092\",
