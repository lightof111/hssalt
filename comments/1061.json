{\"comment\": \"I finally gave up and uninstalled the game too  Just not having fun any more despite having reached rank 4 with it  Its obvious the matchmaker tends to pits you against decks that yours is weakest against  Change decks and the algorithm switches your matchups accordingly  Its not a coincidence  and thats lame  The expansion reduced the number of viable laddering options  increased RNG  loaded the meta with a handful of cards with completely OP effects including the predictable 8 mana Hunter finisher and did almost nothing to address the aggro dominant meta  Now instead of dying on turn 5 unless you draw perfectly   you die on turn 6 against the super cheese decks that have mostly 1 and 2 mana cards  Want to play less seriously Good luck enjoying that on casual  cause you got morons playing top net decks all over  Worst expansion ever  and the devs have shown they really dont care about balancing the game  Priest has become total garbage  The devs have sat on their hands ever since release  telling us the about the office donut buying policy and other stuff no one cares about but not doing their job  Not a single balance  just some lame oh the players can figure out counters with existing cards instead of us doing our jobs and making what could be easy fixes to obviously broken decks and matchups  Its like they just dont want to admit the awful job they did with this expansion  Eff your game  Brode\", \"commentId\": \"22148\", \"commentDate\": \"1467276070\"}, {\"comment\": \"Yes  all my minions were beast  I played the elek on turn 2

then on turn 4 drew my Faceless Behemoth  Pretty much the dream play for that arena deck  dropping a 1010 on turn 4   Problem was  my opponent then dropped a Sludge Belcher and had a few other creatures out that he used to whittle down my beast  and all I could draw after that was junk  Should have skipped the AC and kept the creatures I discarded  tldr Astral Communion in arena is a risk  screwed me this time  As a plus  my opponent friended me after the match and we had a good laugh about it  he said it was a brown pants moment when he saw the 1010 on turn 4\", \"commentId\":
