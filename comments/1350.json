your mind again\", \"commentId\": \"28313\", \"commentDate\": \"1480095116\"}, {\"comment\": \"It would be fine if you could protect yourself but you cant  On turn 10  being at 15 is like   really low  Thats half your starting life  Wtf  In ranked you can be at 2530 and still die in one turn  even with a big board  And this goes for arena as well  a game mode thats not supposed to be about tuned decks  Yet the games almost always devolve into some turn where you just get to send 10 to the face and then fireball or whatever  Like  What is that  At least let both players play all their cards if the game is close  I want more arena games where as a mage for instance youd just let the guy drop a 32  ping it  take 3  ping it next turn and then drop your 44 and win because you took 3 and didnt let him trade his 32 into your 44  I want more of that game and less of the game where one player drops a 123  trades favorably every turn then sends face for an increasingly large amount and just ends up with a 20 point life lead in the midgame from going first or getting lucky early  I want more longterm value cards and more time to set up plays  Right now its like   play a minion  Ok it dies right away  Woo  Moroes  shade of naxx and Dreadsteed are like the only minions in the game that generate some kind of value every turn  Thats such a lacking aspect to the game imo  Nothing is longterm  everything is very influenced by current RNG and luck etc  etc Just doesnt have to be that way  A great example is the COOP brawls where two good players would have a near 100 win rate and two bad players like a 10  That shows you that you can have this game be about skill  but currently the game is too fast and swingy and it forces instant reactions to stay alive rather than reward longterm planning  even with control decks  Only control vs control games require skill  Those are interesting but often they also revolve around RNG  Like the rag vs rag thing where one rag pops the other guys rag  Thats so brutal  Or you could lose a Brawl really badly  or get a bad sylvannas steal at random  All those kinds of things affect control matchups a little much  Anyway    yah ranting about the game is more fun than playing the game lol\", \"commentId\": \"28314\", \"commentDate\": \"1480095331\"}, {\"comment\": \"I CAN DO WHATEVER THE FUCK I WANT DUDE FUCK YOU I DIDNT SAY I AM
