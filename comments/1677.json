than Tirion  Just like the overload drawback the requirement to have played an elemental in the previous turn is meaningless when the elementals are better than vanilla minions anyway  Top bit of game design there   I finally had an elemental shaman on the ropes with lethal the next turn only for him to heal himself out of range with the legenday wanker  whatever its called  Arggh   To counter that Ive had some great back and forth games with my secret mage against Priests  something I havent had for a long time outside of Arena\", \"commentId\": \"35192\", \"commentDate\": \"1491993824\"},

here to tell you a story of an EU Pirate Warrior who got smashed by an absolute casual me obviously  I was playing Miracle Malygos Rogue  rank nine promotion to rank eight if I would win against this dirty Pirate Warrior named snip The game started the usual  I play Swashburglar without Patches  which gives me an interesting Meme card called Explore UnGoro  He on the other hand starts with that originalSouthsea Deckhand pulling out Patches the Pirate Now the deep thinking comes through  I had two Deadly Poison and a Counterfeit Coin  I had the option to just dagger up or go full meme into the Explore UnGoro  You can probapbly guess what I did  Even though it was pretty obvious Im going to lose while doing so  Ya know  Im all in for the fun  so why not  First Discovery Tomb Pillager  I coin him out  Second Discovery Sorcerers Apprentice  Play her  PW goes face  Third Discovery Tinkers Sharpsword Oil  Im a wild player  I play it  PW still continues to go face  ignoring the Tomb Pillager  Fourth Discovery Tinkers Sharpsword Oil  which resulted in definite lethal with my free Deadly Poison  I hope someone actually reads through this because its pretty hilarious if you think about it   PS If anyone plays against this dude make sure to give him a good pounding because this cancerrior really deserves it  Cheers yall\", \"commentId\": \"35196\", \"commentDate\":

draws another charge minion  eviscerate face  game over  Why even bother playing the games against Rogue anymore  This is literally the 5th Ive faced today and every single one has gotten the quest completed between turns 4 and 6  I dont even hate Rogue as a class  but between the cheap elementals  broken 11 drops  and the abundance of easy bounce and card draw    Rogue just have the perfect

 The deck is simply more powerfull than Grim   I die to many time on turn 6 against Quest Rogue and Pirate Warrior to simply think  That is was because of missplay i do or a bad mulligan choise  That my opponent got nut draw and was skillful    That I need more Taunt  simply because  it prevent me from a certain death   Im salty  I miss Reno Jackson  Jade Druid and Priest Dragon in Standard\",
