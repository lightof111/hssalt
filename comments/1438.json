draws ever so I die a slow death   Here is an example of one of the games I play Have only 10 buff cards and 20 monster cards  I draw buff spell cards in a row until I die My winrate is around 10 and yes I know how to play  I even play against friends using the same deck and get stomped due to being unable to even use any cards in my hand Most of my games have me extremely close to winning  Ill be around 15 HP and my opponent at 1 HP  With only 7 cards left  my opponent draws some card that has 7 attack  I will draw all the buff cards in my deck until I die  There would be like 2 buff cards and 6 monster cards  Inevitably I will just lose thanks to RNG  I usually win against bots but its difficult when your strongest card is a Core Hound You guys talk like everyone has a Cho  Shredder  or Doomsayer  how about having only the starter cards and constantly having to disenchant the millions of them you constantly get  Dont even get me started on Arena  That place is a game mode set for

hearthstone is shitty reason 626Oh  Guess I lose  Yeah I have 5 cards in hand  20 life and 15 cards in my deck  but I didnt remove every minion for one turn  so I took 10  and this turn Im taking 10  so now Im at 10  aka 0  Yay  Would have been fun to play this game out  but I guess well just stop 15 of the way through instead\", \"commentId\": \"30156\", \"commentDate\": \"1482884477\"}, {\"comment\": \"Im salty as hell about two WINS  Why They epitomized how Hearthstone is so much more about your deck and luck than skill  These all happened at Rank 3  so not complete scrubs  I was Dragon Reno Priest with OTK package  Example 1  vs  MiraclePirateSmorc Rogue On my turn 7 he has 55 Songstealer from smuggler and 54 Pillager  I have a Netherspite Historian  I play a Wyrmrest agent and run the netherspite into the Pillager  putting at 53  to set up for an excavated next turn  On his turn 7  after Ive done this  he does the following Songstealer into my Wyrmrest to put it at 53  plays LEEROY for face damage I was at 28  I believe and then plays SI Agent to my face  This is at rank 3  Hes heavily favored  And he literally hands me the best Excavated Evil fucking possible  I won  How the hell is this dude rank 3 Oh  right  cuz he plays Small Time BucOP and Patches turn 1 and smorcs  Example 2  vs Jade Shaman First  he starts the game by playing two totems then his 11 golem into my Cleric and Twilight Whelp  Free 3 cards for me  Actually end up getting FOUR cards from my Cleric before I suicide it in because I have 9 cards and dont want the healing totem punish  LOL  Then just to show how elite he is   hes still going to win because he drew every Jade Card in his deck  So heres the winning turn set up  I have Reno and DracOP on board  He has a Loot Hoarder  Azure Drake  He is at 25 health  He plays Brann  Coin  Spirit  Spirit  His golems being 88  99  1010  1111   EXCEPT do you notice the problem here Instead of trading in his Hoarder and Drake he GOES FACE with them  What does this accomplish Well  it wins me the game  First  it leaves me 9 damage on the board  My hand is Spawn of Shadows  Finley  Garrison  My MAX damage is 20 with that combo  If he kills the OP  I cant win  But maybe hes never seen the combo from Priest  fine  regardless he only spawns an 88 and 99 golem BECAUSE THEY RUN OUT OF ROOM  By trading in  regardless of my combo  he REMOVES a 56 for me AND GAINS A CARD AND 1615 OF STATS   So I win the next face by running my 9 damage into his face and pushing 18 from hand  If he had killed either of my minions its an unwinnable position for me  These two games are at rank 3  You have to play a lot of games with a high winning  to get rank 3  Its such an insane example of how skill isnt the primary factor in this game\",

body is overkill   considering its a good play even if you cant activate it most of the time  Something like a 36 would have been much more consistent with the value\", \"commentId\": \"30158\",

worst meta Ive ever seen for brewing   Look at  httpwww vicioussyndicate comvsdatareaperreport30  for proof of this    Aggro shaman has adopted pirate strategies and is arguably the best aggro deck

mechanic kills attrition control decks without burst   its actually pirate jade shamn thats the real secret up and Comer imo    Good job on poor management of card design blizzard       Are we enjoying shaman stone Im not  these are  the most boring and minor skill intensive types of decks that rule the metagame  why havent broken 1 and 2 drops been nerfed yet\", \"commentId\": \"30160\",

been playing this game since beta Who Goes Thar bullshit mixed with a deck of 28 strong direct damage tools brings back the horrors of Undertaker meta when the game was decided by turn 2  If you were under 20 HP turn 2  you had an obsurd chance to lose the game  and this happened ONLY when your opponent got an insane opening of overpowered 1 drops  Nobody really hates Drakonid Operative  nobody rages at Rag this hard and rags been around forever  Combo might be cancer but at least there are answers and counterplay to that style of deck why blizzard KEEPS PUMPING OUT GARBAGE OVERSTATTED ONE DROPS is beyond me  Its complete shit game design  The RNG has been moved from card text to draw if you get the nuts which is getting easier and easier with the sheer number of insane 1 drops you just win   Its garbage  One drops that have strong stat lines or easily obtainable conditions undertaker  tunnel trogg  mana wyrm  who goes thar  flame imp have always been the most frustrating cards in the game because when you draw it  you shit on your opponents   and when you dont  your entire deck becomes SUBSTANTIALLY worse tempo mage  undertaker decks pre nerf  faceaggro shaman  Well designed 1drops should fill the niche roles abusive  babbling yes  even with radical text rng and young priestess fill the cards stats dont hold its value  the effect does  Even cards like chowmistress are better designed because at least they have a notable drawback that significantly hinders their usability    Stupid  Frustrating  Overstatted  One drops\", \"commentId\": \"30163\", \"commentDate\":
