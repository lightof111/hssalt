RNG  Shaman rolling spellpower totem as 14  RNG  disco lock discarding golems unless properly set up  RNG  Oh  and then there is Yogg  I could go on with tons of examples  You are misguided if you think that this game has anything to do with skill  Nearly all games are wonlost based on RNG rolls  There is a reason why people do not enjoy watching HS esports rofl  I honestly dont understand why Blizz keeps adding RNG cards to the game  One would think they would learn from the feedback and let RNG cards slowly die  making HS actually esports viable  The next xpac is the decider for me  I have been playing since beta  but I can barely stand the current meta  I actually enjoyed secret hunter  undertaker and secret pally metas much more than this shaman and mage infested standard and mage monopoly in arena  If the next xpac does not make control decks viable  Im out\", \"commentId\": \"28387\", \"commentDate\": \"1480199221\"}, {\"comment\": \"I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE HEARTHSTONE
