mode  not just yours personally ive never seen the point of playing casual   isnt ladder better since you will get the golden portrait I guess for high ranked players can be good for relaxing whit some weird deck once in a while  so they dont lose rank   but at lower rank is the same shit isnt it  you wont get matched whit newbs in casual if thats what you expecting   might aswell just try your decks on ladder  now if you are high rank why would you care losing in casual whit a weird deck that will most likely make you lose     on the other hand ppl who farm on casual whit aggro or tier 1 decks are very dumb i agree on that\", \"commentId\": \"25252\", \"commentDate\": \"1472836285\"}, {\"comment\": \"Because Im not particularly interested in seeing how well my fun Shadowcaster deck

player with a single card turning a lost game against a control which the control has to work fucking hard for into a win  Fuck you all fucking yogg users  Go play yatzy  its basically the same

brainless people playing it  Like seriously is there a single game mode without shitty sad netdecks I dropped to rank 20 on purpose to play fun decks working homebrewn decks  but mainly resolving about alot of weird unused cards  hell I dont care about wins  my winrate might aswell be 25 and I would care less  The problem  shitty brainless netdeckers    WHY FFS would you play a fully netdecked tier 1 or maybe tier 2 for a change deck at rank 20  No you re not competetive  you re at total dumpster rank  You re by defenition not competetive  playing to win or whatever sad excuse since you re playing the most viable decks and still losing this much that you cant get past rank 20  Yes I can beat those decks easily and I mostly do  thats not my problem multiple times legend player  every month rank 5 since the second month i started playing  Last season I was in the top 100 EU legend wild rank and 95 were 100 netdecked old decks or 100 netdecked standard decks  mostly secret palas  I M FFFFFIN BORED BY REPETETIVE SHIT  People that do this shit should delete the game  there is no reason for you to play it anymore  Try going outside and get some creativity because you seem braindead and deadweight  I do love this game  I especially like deckbuilding  Its more than 50 off the game  The odds of drawing a certain card you need depends on the build just like the playstyle  the choises only come second once you ve drawn a card   I get that people use lame excuses like playing to win or competetive to 100 netdeck till they never reach legend rank  but the general lack of originality kills this game\", \"commentId\": \"25261\", \"commentDate\": \"1472867431\"}, {\"comment\": \"Fucking call of the wild and aggro decks Who counters aggro seriously I want to play control

of course  Fuck it  fuck face hunters  Before call of of the wild  we can say like  yeah they have a lot of damage but no late game  Now they have it  Absolutely fucking beautiful strategy mate  Smorc
