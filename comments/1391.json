"[{\"comment\": \"Played against a golden Mage at Rank 18  yesterday and I could bring him down to 1hp  Next turn  he fireballs me to 1hp as well and still has 3 mana left  so easy heropower for him  Instead  he chooses different spells  hovers over his own face and my minions and lets the rope come out just to BM me  It didnt make me mad  just sad to see such a nolife BMer at rank 18 even though his hero is golden  I dont get what kind of entertainment people get when they do this  just shows that there are stupid assholes everywhere\", \"commentId\": \"29157\", \"commentDate\":

wish I could talk to my opponent and ask him what he finds so fun about playing that abomination of a Deck     I had to coin Reno Jackson on turn 5 to survive that onslaught I was at 13 health on fucking turn 5 and I had already played Refreshment Vendor and hed had to go through a 45 taunt     I know that this Deck is just like old Face Hunter and healing and taunts should destroy it  the problem is that the only good healing option is Reno and its 1 card out of 30 assuming you even get to turn 6 and even thought Taunt minions got a bit better none of them is Sludge Belcher      TLDR I hate Pirate Warrior and Im salty cause I have to fill my Deck with Tech cards to deal with them when Id love it to be more greedy for mirrors\", \"commentId\": \"29176\", \"commentDate\":
