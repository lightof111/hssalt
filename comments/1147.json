 Edit  after reading some of your posts You seem to be very salty  Just completely drop every single CThun  Yogg  NZoth  Reno deck  Relying on drawing one card to win or loose  Yogg is frustrating  Then forget about every single combomiracle deck  Again  you rely on drawing specific combos to not get fukd  Build a proper tempo deck  ideally for Wild  because standard hit tempo decks really hard  Midrange hunter  tempo mage or something similar  Good curve  to make sure that you maximize your chances of drawing usefull cards  Oldschool shredders  mad scientists  Dr Boom etc  or wait for Karazhan and build tempo beast druid\", \"commentId\": \"23981\", \"commentDate\": \"1470917055\"}, {\"comment\": \"Frustrated with my last match  Decided to leave after the amount of emote abuse my

fourth card    say you have a 31 a 22 and a 11 against a mage  he has no board or maybe 1 smallish creature out   if you dont play anything you lose tempo and all your momentum because hes going to ping the 1 hp creature  there is basically nothing to do except play your card and pray he doesnt have tech    its just a bullshit card  far worse then AOEs which are understandable in card games    but stealing your opponents hard earned cards     you think in any way thats fun or needed in this game that 5 drop he waited till turn 5 to play    and then to snatch it up just like that  because he must be punished for playing more den twee cards  why even be able to play more then 3 cards if blizzard doesnt want you to  midess well patch that shit in next patch can no longer play more than 3
