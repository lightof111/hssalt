players as well  I havent seen a single one play around any kind of removal  just misplay and still win because they are shamans  How the fuck are they doing this Zoo has empty hand on turn 4  double Silverware Golem from perfect discards and full board played into Brawl which I obviously didnt have  proceeding to topdeck into Doomguard  Never ever have I had this luck when I played Zoo and they
