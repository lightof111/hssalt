requirement  for that value     What worries me is that in the premade recipe of rogues deck  in Hearthstone game itself  the Deck is ALREADY overpowered and it was made by the devs  So they Must believe that the deck is balanced to create a premade formula for it     But HOW the hell you think that deck is balanced   When on turn 67 u spam 55 charging minions with 12 mana Thats absolutely insane  its just not fair     THE nerf should be to add 2 more minions to complete the quest\", \"commentId\": \"34885\", \"commentDate\": \"1491663709\"}, {\"comment\": \"Rogue quest requires zero skill  None  There are way too many cheap ways to bounce minions  They should have made it 6 bounces  instead of 4 for the quest  It would still be strong in control matchups  but at least there would be more time to find possible answers  Now  the deck is just OP and destroying the game   AGAIN  Which is frustrating  because other than the rogue quest I really enjoy the new expansion  There are plenty of lovely new decks  decks that are strong  yet not too strong  The balance is there  So why this rogue quest Bye balance\", \"commentId\": \"34886\", \"commentDate\": \"1491663904\"},

what Jade and Pirate Warrior did last expansion  were just seeing a repeat of it now  where Im pretty much forced to play aggro decks to burst out Rogue before t46 enough that he cant win not as easy as you think btw  since they still have BackstabEvisFan and switch to controlling the board when they realize its aggro just like other aggro vs aggro decks do instead of greeding for the quest  Who the fuck at Blizzard tested this shit Honestly  Honestly most broken shit Ive seen so far  There is absolutely nothing you can do to stop that shit with any deck thats even slightly slower than it  4 minions is way too fast  should be 6  either that or they need to nerf the minions into 33s or something  I tried running Handlock  for the same reason Trump tried running it  because the Rogue deck lacks removal outside of Eviscerate  so I thought Id be able to cheat out fatties early and beat them  It was reasonably successful if I got the Giants out early  but in every other situation Id just die  Do I fucking have to give in to the cancer and play Pirate Warrior  goddammit Blizzard  Its not like that is even safe  because all the other classes have started running Golakka Crawler in their deck to counter it for exactly that reason  Also going to complain about the state of Paladin here  Yes  there is a viable deck in Elemental Handbuff Paladin  for now  Its only thanks to the Tempo swings that Elementals bring right nowthe regularity with which you discover Rag Lightlord that they are viable  notably lacks removal of any sort the most popular decklist by Savjz lacks both Equality because handbuff antisynergy etc etc I presume  and couldnt fit in Aldor because of the Elemental curve  instead slamming down big fatties hoping they will stick  and since the Paladin deck as of itself lacks tempocard draw Im sure as soon as the meta settles down the deck will fall back down to tier 3  but its at least something  at least for a while  although Im not sure how long before I cant play Paladin anymore\", \"commentId\": \"34899\", \"commentDate\": \"1491669996\"}, {\"comment\": \"Nope  nope  thats not it   The assholes that defend that shit are making up LIES about how you just play deck XXXXXX and your win rate against it will be high   Bull   Shit    The deck is fucking broekn beyond belief   You get Tusk Boar and Deckhand Pirate that both have charge   Two 55 CHARGE minions that cost one fucking mana each    Fukcing seriously  Plus  they have that fuckhead shadowstep and other cards that return minions to hand to be played again since they only cost one fucking mana   I hate this fucking quest shit   Worst idea ever\", \"commentId\": \"34900\", \"commentDate\": \"1491670020\"}, {\"comment\": \"So the time has finaly come  After 1 5 years of playing i can t do it anymore Every day i log in and say to myself this day i am not going to get angry  i am just going to have a fun time and play a fun game That is what blizzard has promised me  come spend your money we have a great game for you But          they dont i have been conned Some days after just one game my blood is boiling again  sure everyone is allowed to net deck and all i can do it myself but i dont want to my mistake sure but that is just how i want to play the game What make my blood boils is the amount of luck 80  of my oppenents has  They have every answer to every move i make and because i am not net decking that is just not possible because i have really strange decks  But still every answer is for my oppenent Or they get the build your own victory of Ikea blueprint in their hands  first you play this card and secondly this and yup i am dead at turn 7 This happens most games i play And then surprise a win streak  it is going good  Fun games lasting to deep in the decks  Making good plays on both sides  ohh how i enjoy these games  At the end of the tunnel level 15 is glimmering  Im almost there And then blizzard and his bearded leprocaun from hell Ben Brode  pull the plug The sewer opens and a wave of shitty luck blasts me back to level 20  and there is nothing i can do Bad mulligan  bad card draw oppenent has golden starters every card i play is answerd ect ect  I cant do this anymore  i wish there is some way to hold blizzard accountable because this is not the game that was prommised to me I have just deleted my game and i will at least take a month of 3 to think if i ever will play this stinkink  rotten game anymore  But please guys dont spend your money anymore they just dont deserve it  A very sad player\", \"commentId\": \"34901\",
