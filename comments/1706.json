powerhouse deck  Its such a pain to queue up to this when youre just trying to have some fun in ranked with nonmeta decks in the 1510 ranks  Played 4 matches just now w a buff Pally variant  3 rogues and 1 quest warrior  Slammed the warrior but it was a good game  and lost easily to the quest rogues with each completing their quests by turn 5 max  Thats even with Dirty Rat in my starting hand  And people say this deck is okay  its absolutely not  you shouldnt have to adjust an entire archetype of a deck with counters to compensate for how OP one single deck is  Thats ludicrous  And even if you
