Hearthstone is ok but cards could be improved  However  the players  the community   it just feels soo toxic  The amount of bming  roping  Its like people playing as though their lives are at stake but its just a fucking casual game Might even move onto shadowverse  seeing as Kripp has been playing that and says its an ok game\", \"commentId\": \"36281\", \"commentDate\": \"1493500312\"},
