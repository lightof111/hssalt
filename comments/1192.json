clicking on whats green on the screen and win without considering their moves  And you cant do anything about a turn one tunnel trogg  turn 2 totem golem  turn 3 coin feral spirit play  and they are most likely to have it  just like hunters always have turn 8 call of the wild turn 9 call of the wild  and there isnt really much you can do against that  I prefer playing reno mage  but sometimes ice block isnt enough to make it to turn 6 and reno  and even if I can use reno  Im dead in 2 turns  Totally ruins the whole game experience  Whenever I get a control warrior for an opponent or something like that  Im glad because I can finally have some fun and it doesnt matter if I lose or win  Im still having fun as long as its not a heavy aggro deck that requires 0 IQ to play  I just fell back from rank 12 to rank 17 because all Im facing are SMOrc FACE FACE FACE FACE FACE FACE decks\", \"commentId\": \"24942\", \"commentDate\": \"1472401468\"}, {\"comment\": \"No idea mate I dont remember

to rank 14  Hows that even possible  Well  very likely considering the Dev Teams new fantastic approach of making the game as new aka trash player friendly as possible  The tier 1 decks should all be supercheap  autopilot  with as minimal chance as possible of being punished as possible  All you need to do is play blatantly powercreep cards on curve each turn  and win  Tuskarr Totemic into Totem Golem or Mana Tide Totem and you have lost the game  Seriously its so unfair  You play anything that isnt hunter  dragon warrior  Zoo or Shaman  You will have to sweat every single game out with perfect piloting  while your opponent just plays on curve and goes face  A mistake YOU make is fatal  but your opponents snowball deck is simply rewarded for ignoring favorable trades  Karazhan was completely pointless  It didnt affect the meta a single bit except making hunter a lot stronger  and the final wing wont do anything either except give Zoo a new 1drop which it soooo desperately needed     Is this how Ben Brode wants the game\", \"commentId\": \"24951\", \"commentDate\": \"1472403839\"}, {\"comment\": \"Absolute mental retardation that has become Hearthstone  Aggro Shaman
