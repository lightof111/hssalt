but now the more stronger decks are getting known  hate that people just flock to certain obvious decks and dont create their own  With some decks  there are weaknesses  However for some  theyre just cancerous  Ahem priest   fucking 100k health with no fucking weaknesses And you have a fucking 13 that gives them draw with heals Oh lets not forget 34 that gives a minion extra 3 fucking health  Fucking broken  Oh and theres taunt warrior with like 10k health as well and they get fucking rag power  If Blizzard made cards to counter pirates  how about counters to minions with unbelievable amount of fucking high health there is very little in terms of counters  crawler is a great e g of countering pirates  It gets a good increase in stats  Shitt  playing against cancerous twats in casual has just really put me off  From misplays to complete fucking face face face  I question how retarded is my opponent Not just that though  some of the decks played are just absolute bullshit
