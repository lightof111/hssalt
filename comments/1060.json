since Im the fuckin unluckiest person in this planet  it just has to go perfect for my opponent every single game  If only  ONLY one time they didnt have the perfect answers no matter how I play around them within the first freaking 10 cards in their hand  If not the shamans  then the warriors  Always ghoul  brawl and execute when needed  and I recorded in an excel sheet the number of times they had a winaxe on turn 2 at least the ones they actually played 27 out of 34 warriors  How is this even possible   Edit another 2 Cthun warriors in a row  both had winaxe on turn 2  One one was fun particular  he won a 1 in 6 and stole my ragnaros  but the noob still managed to lose due to his shit plays  If this bad players are at rank 3 already  that just proves how much skill is needed at this point\", \"commentId\": \"22116\", \"commentDate\": \"1467213021\"}, {\"comment\": \"Trying to have fun with Reno Paladin  Control Shaman  Yogg Hunter  PLZ STOP PLAYING CANCER ON CASUAL  Turn 3
