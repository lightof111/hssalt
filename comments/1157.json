Executus  and Millhouse but whatever  Drafted what was easily the best arena deck Ive ever had the pleasure of playing  Tons of mech synergy  4 four Consecrations and an Equality  and as I said three legendaries Deathwing  Ysera  and normal Hogger  Proceeded to only get 4 wins because of poor draws only saw Ysera once in 7 games  but Deathwing was always right there either after my mulligan or on T13 and some amazing plays by my opponents  Not necessarily salty  but super disappointed  Figured it at least somewhat fits in with the rest of the content in this thread  Especially since getting three legendaries in one draft when paired with my average level of luck in the arena likely means that I wont get one offered for the next 50 or so runs\", \"commentId\": \"24180\", \"commentDate\":

forgot that there was that box in the left that could serve as evidence but I have a friend who witnessed and I took pictures of Evolve fucking me up but I dont have a recording software  I actually considered making youtube videos because when I win its well done and sometimes lucky like when I played Tempo Mage yesterday my opponent played Divine Pally and had a full board so I played yogg and then he cast twisting nether then quick shot then lava burst and then i won  When im in a losing streak its actually very entertaining to watch cuz the opponent has a very ridiculous way of winning like top deck twisting nether  evolve into triple 4 mana 77  play a five card combo  Aviana bullshit  etc  Anyway the next time I have a losing streak I will post pictures\", \"commentId\": \"24183\",

they made these changes  Casual matches dont count towards completing quests Make more quests that dont require you to win a game Make more neutral quests that dont require you to play a specific

ladder system  which is completly oudated  they could introduce an experience system which will grant you gold or other rewards by leveling up  Something similiar as Overwatch  where you are rewarded with 1 Loot Box for each Level  Leveling is not tied to winning but rather by spending time with the game  depended on how many units you killed  how many turns the game lasted etc   That would make every deck you play equal and does not favor quick games  which supports tempoaggressiv oriented decks\", \"commentId\": \"24190\", \"commentDate\": \"1471274073\"}, {\"comment\": \"I love when I

that you are some kind of new player with a noob deck he will destroy you and not concede  If heshe detects that you might be some experienced long time player with a netdeck those most likely concede to one another  I brought up this topic  because it was all about protection for new guys and not how its fair that farmers amongst themself battle it out  in the concede matchup  5050 is not of
