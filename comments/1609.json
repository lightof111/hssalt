developers until about a month after the expansion to see if they can correct its issues  Over the last 2 and a half years theyve shaken my confidence by how slow theyve been to react to problems  their philosophy towards short versus long games  and some generally poor design and balance  These recent balance changes are a pretty poor effort   even by their standards  What they dont understand it seems is that hearthstone is a pendulum which will keep swinging back to the same point  You make some changes  and things change  class popularity spikes or falls whiche people figure things out  but eventually if you dont make sufficient balance changes  normal service will resume  Play any game against Shaman and it wont take you long to realise their cards are still patently better than every other elses  They simply have it all   The popularity of shaman is slowly growing again as new builds are designed   I dont like also that a recent thing theyve done is to respond to overpowered classes by going other classes overpowered cards  Obviously you can see what theyre thinking but Id much rather they increased the general standard of cards  maybe even considered card buffs  rather than giving for example my favourite golden class  priest  one off ridiculous cards like Draconid Operative  Its short sighted because later down the line priest might become oppressive and this card might end up nerfed  It wouldnt be necessary to make cards like that if most priest cards werent just terrible   Jade meanwhile is a sleeping giant   it doesnt take a genius to realise that jade druid limits design space because the moment we get a control meta  its unbeatable  Right now the meta is quick to keep it in check but in the future this could change  A deck with unlimited cards and if it survives  1 mana 12 12s each turn Right  Hearthstone deserves some loyalty but eventually the strength of the brand  the fame of blizzard and its beautiful and hilarious artwork wont be enough  the new expansions got to be big\", \"commentId\": \"33786\", \"commentDate\": \"1489761719\"}, {\"comment\": \"HOW THE FUCK CAN I NAVER GET A GOOD START WHEN I PLAY PIRATE WARRIOR AND WHEN I CHANGE TO
