{\"comment\": \"Im six wins away from golden Warlock but Ive lost all desire to play this game  Cant play in standard because the only semiviable Warlock deck is Zoo and its absolutely destroyed by the hundreds of Shamans  and cant play wild because its Secret Paladin after Secret Paladin after Secret Paladin with the occasional Dragon Priest and Freeze Mage thrown in to bore you to death  In my experience theres about four decks commonly played across both formats and its boring as shit  I might just construct shitty  fun decks and concede back to rank 20 every time I get to 15 or so  At least then I might see decks that I cant predict card for card  If that doesnt work I guess Ill just stick to arena\", \"commentId\": \"26841\", \"commentDate\": \"1476077569\"}, {\"comment\": \"burst

complaint about the stale meta in both standard and wild  A lack of motivation to get those wins  Not an inability to do so  I was also partially blaming myself for sticking to meta decks to get those wins instead of trying to tinker with my own  Im one win away now and instead of rushing off to grab that win like I did with my last hero Im waiting to have a quest that applies  When I do get that win I think Im going to drop going for the golden heroes and just try to have fun again  Hopefully thats something I can manage  Just tilted and bitching lol\", \"commentId\": \"26843\",
