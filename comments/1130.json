cards  killed all my stuff ONE BY ONE with plenty of other targets on the field and stayed on the board as 75  It was like the best  the most precise Yogg Ive ever seen\", \"commentId\": \"23601\",

the best when they suck dicks all day  i play a casino mage but entirely casino i play even servant of yogg saron and yeah iwin games and most of all i want to have some fun  almost everyone BMs me and when they finally lose idk do they understand that they sound like faggot idiots or even if they win why BM also why play so seriously  im rank 15 almost all my games are vs the dragon warrior tier 1 cancer or shaman  like wtf people play this game only to feel better or superior about their miserable lives or something no one plays for fun whats the fun in winning in 4 turns many of them rope and eventually make mistakes on top     like wtf is this some contest of whos the best idiot i bet if i photo 70 or more of hearthstone community will be ugly fat or not rejections of society with some low education and brain capacity  i know in this forum there are many grown up and kinda reasonable people but fuck me inside the game its like yeah idk fuck it theres no way things will change as someone else said to me free game  popular gathers all the trash\", \"commentId\": \"23602\", \"commentDate\": \"1470336809\"}, {\"comment\": \"and another thing that annoys me in this game a lot is that any total moron noob skilless idiot can win against me if he plays  a cancer netdeck and goes face  this game shouldnt even have ranked or be an esports it should have only casual cause it is a joke  the skill matters like 10  i won an unwinnable game just with yogg some hour ago  opponent had 20 health 2 minions and a 1212 vancleef on board i had nothing i played yogg and i won the next turn  yeah idk this game should be for fun only  i like it thats why i play it for 2 years now but maybe the community have to start to think of it as a joke and play less seriously decks\",
