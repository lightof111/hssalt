expect it to drop as a lot of my opponents were probably not the most skilled at lower ranks but still  160 is a pretty nice number\", \"commentId\": \"34902\", \"commentDate\": \"1491673192\"},

get high rank that Blizzard will not be able to resist their greed to sell those packs so they will NOT nerf for far too long  This is the expansion that will open peoples eyes to Blizzards broken game con broken packs  sell as long as possible  nerf  repeat  Its just not fun playing a game where a handful of decks are so OP  People like to win so they play the broken decks  Every expansion Blizzard finds a new bunch of suckers to con money out of  But the suckers are starting to see the con  Brode will probably be removed from the design team and deservedly so  but it might be too late\", \"commentId\": \"34911\", \"commentDate\": \"1491683570\"}, {\"comment\": \"Well  I opened up 58 packs and lost all enthusiasm for UnGoro  I got 3 legendaries from the packs  which I know is supposed to be about average  but it has always felt like too few to me  Especially when the legendaries I received are all useless against the meta  I cannot even get my Maeve quest completed because I have nothing close to competitive against all of the Quest Rogues out there  Im sure it will calm down and Ill come up with something I can play and win with  But right now Standard is not fun  I guess I should just craft the Rogue quest  Im sure it is going to be nerfed to raise the count to 5 or 6 minions  so Ill get my dust back  I am just really disappointed right now  I did have fun in
