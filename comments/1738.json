boring ass Taunt minions until you let the game decide by RNG who wins  This is not even waht original tank control warrior used to be  Not even the mirror is interesting anymore because whoever completes the braindead quest first most of the time just wins    And no im not that Kind of player  I just try to have fun playing cool decks KazakusControl Priest  Tarim Paladin no aggro murlocs or

tired of Standard laddering after facing a combination of pirate warrior and quest rogues for 8 consecutive games I switched to control warrior in wild  had a lot of succes with the deck last season

of them on the battlefield as soon as they completed the quest at T5  6   I think ill just log off for a couple of hours and try to lower my blood presure a bit\", \"commentId\": \"36461\",

how to balance cards that the only way they  could think of to try and balance aggro is to create an archetype rewarding you to sit on your arse making no plays or decision whatsoever  just plonking huge minions down   You could do a thousand and one other things whilst playing taunt warrior because it requires no skill or concentration  And at the end of the game what does it all come back down

Priest gets one card from my deck from Crystaline Oracle  its Harrison Jones just as I had played my Medivh Mirror 2  Lethal on board  I have a damaged Tortollon Shellraiser and a bunch of other large guys from Free From Amber  the guy steals the Tortollan with Potion of Madness casts triple Divine Spirit then Inner Fire for lethal pretty sure he also had power word shield because Tortollan was on quite low health  Bear in mind we had only drawn just past half of our decks  Mirror 3  Opponent steals 3 Elise Trailblazers with his Drakonid Operatives of course he gets 3rd Operative with Netherspite the last card in my deck was Elise herself but of course its too little too late by then  Just a few examples of the clown fiesta of Priest mirrors  it usually comes down to who steals the best cards and oddly it can help to have a weaker control list in this kind of situation\", \"commentId\": \"36470\", \"commentDate\": \"1493812885\"}, {\"comment\": \"Me too Im much more mad andor
