distress which are clearly empty threats is simply childish   Are you so young lacking critical thinking so much to associate anger on a very specific time stamp in order to  perpetuate it on the

shit your opponents do all the time Youll do that  once a month  the rest matches will be crap  Play face hunter  only get damage spells and weapons in the first 10 cards  Play secret paladin  get all the secrets on turn one  or all the lategame and BoK without any early play to avoid getting snowballed  I am not made to spread captain obvious netdecks  I either fight with whatever it works for me and with work I mean  have at least certain ammount of fun  or dont at all  That being said  how can you have fun when you get secret paladind at turn 3  and even then the secrets played are exact counters to whatever you do the next 2 turns Well    sometimes with dragon priest I made that    but sadly today I was a rogue\", \"commentId\": \"27064\", \"commentDate\": \"1476635030\"}, {\"comment\": \"I get where youre coming from  Blizzard never has been very good with balance  so its pretty likely that after a new expansion the balance will change  I think there was a dorkly comic about it    cant find it right now but basically it came down to Blizzards idea of balance being trading the massive advantage from one character type to another  If you ever played Wow  before they simplified the skill trees  it was very much play this way or fuck you  There was one ideal way to spec any given character  and if you specced it any differently  nobody would invite you to raids  One really good trend in Hearthstone is that midrange is becoming more dominant  which makes some sense  I can understand not enjoying playing aggro  or not enjoying playing midrange  but I think its a good idea for everyone to try different play style  especially if youre frustrated  I originally really just liked tempo mage and aggro hunter  but for a while control was more dominant and it became very frustrating  so I tried a control warrior and found that I really enjoyed playing it   Then again  I have a power gamer attitude when it comes to this sort of game  I know I wont go very far if I play control right now  so Im going to avoid playing control  This is easier considering that I enjoy all the different playstyles\", \"commentId\": \"27065\", \"commentDate\":

guess what Full spell hand until turn 3  then draw a fucking Dragonlord  and turn 4 Alextrasza  and I died at turn 5 because I only heropowered Im not saying that they should nerf this or it  but cmon

Hopefully Blizzard learn from their mistake that when players want Shaman to be viable they dont mean give them broken cards   As a player that plays any class I understand how broken aggro decks are and how frustrating it is losing to them  Played control and win rate was about 50  and aggro win rate is about 70  No matter how skillfully you pull of your combos to clear board and keep your minions alive  you still lose to aggro most the time because you cannot do anything until midgame which is too late\", \"commentId\": \"27070\", \"commentDate\": \"1476639392\"}, {\"comment\": \"If I
