 I need to blow off some steamMy favourite deck so far was renolock  I know some people hate that card and probably the deck too  but if I could  I would replace him with a far more fair healing card like Jinyu Waterspeaker  The reason  I liked this deck  is because 1 it was 100 control I didnt include the combo 2 it was at the same time very flexible 3 fun  because I had to make decisions 4 I cant say  that my deck was oppressive to others  every one could counter it and it countered many decks   However the last expansion wasnt pleasant for everyone  People ran the same decks over and over and there was little variety  it was terrible  how the game became rockpaperscissors  People wanted a change  they wanted to throw these decks into the wild format  And I also wanted that  even if I had to say goodbye to a deck  that reflected my play style  Honestly  I was really looking forward to the experience  that i witnessed with the first rotation  So we can all have a fresh format  which we can enjoy  And I really liked and still like the cards from the Ungoro expansion  Many of them are well balanced  the taunts  the light removals like Grievous Bite  legendaries like Hemet  that I thought will bring innovative and creative decks and even the pack fillers didnt seem like pack fillers  I also welcomed the quest mechanic as a new keyword  so that would make 9 new types of decks  But    the thing that annoyed me the most is yet again how tempo decks always overwhelm the meta  Im looking at the quest rogue  While I acknowledge the fact  that it depends on draws  I still think  that its way too strong in comparison to other quests  Look at the warlock quest for a second  while Im not saying  that its incompletable  by the time  when you get the reward  you wouldnt have achieved much  But what bothers me the most  is how the quest rogue doesnt allow for other slow decks to develop  You may argue and mention taunt warr and plantlock  yeah  fill your deck with taunts and play the prolong game  when you think  that you exhausted them  But those decks wont do any good against midrangy decks or with decks with a real strategy  Tech cards like Dirty Rat are also great  but filling your deck with these 1 wont win you the game every time in this MU  2 may be a problem  if you face other decks  that dont rely on combos  And another thing  the tech cards are really great  I love them  BUT the problem with them is that they are situational  The decks with a real strategy works very well in many situations  while those answers only works in specific ones  But the worst part is when people say If you want to beat that deck  you have to adapt yours or simply play better decks  that counter the quest one  Like pirate and zoo  Yes  because thats what we wanted a whole expansion  We lacked on fast decks and the game became boring wo them  Thats the thing I hate the most  If theres a strong deck  it has to beaten by an aggro one  in this case by another broken and non interactive deck pirate  Wasnt that the issue we wanted to prevent in this expansion Werent we fed up with decks constantly popping up And even after the first hours  when I logged in  the game was flooded with that deck  IN THE FIRST FEW HOURS  Do you think  that thats healthy Wasnt that the case with PW with the gadgetzan release  Im not defending only control decks  but also others  that have a game plan after t10  I dont plan to go to fatigue every time with a slow deck  I dont want to exhaust my opponent out of resources and then jump into the game to defeat them  I just want to play against others in a match  that lasts couple of turns  I want to make decisions  not just Oh  i hope I draw my AoEheal now  And like one said  if you do well against a fast deck  your opponent will concede  wo you playing the rest of your deck  you just made a comeback  you are ready to play and they suddenly end the game  All so unsatisfying\", \"commentId\": \"34970\",
