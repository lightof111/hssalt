stop playing it all together  The reasons being as followed  I feel as though Im barely even playing the game myself when I play it  It feels like Blizzard is holding and steering my hands throughout all the game nowadays  New cards have such obvious synergies with little to no room for experimentation that its basically Blizzard telling us to play this or that deck with exactly these cards  The latest expansion takes this to the extreme with the gangs   I feel theres a serious lack of imagination and exciting ideas lately  A large number of the new cards are slight variations of giving one or more cards in your hand better stats  They had a huge opportunity of making a card like Don HanCho unique and fun making use of being buffed or something else  yet they simply made him give a card 55  A lot of new cards are simply about giving you random cards  The fun in playing is lost to me  The only fun part left is the card images  voices and animations  Not with one card in this latest expansion did I feel this is clever or I cant wait to add this card to my collection   I feel like a casual game has gone even more casual and dumbed down to the point that I barely even think while playing it  You simply play on curve or you lose  At two mana you play a two mana minion  at three mana    and so on  Random effects almost feel dominating in the game and most times the games dont reach turn 10  Its like the game has taken a direction where youre just supposed to play for ten minutes while youre taking a shit  I dont want to come off like those Facebook users who makes a dramatic announcement of them leaving Facebook for good just for them to return after a couple of days again  I just want to blow off steam about how I feel of this game since about last year  Thinking about it  I have just played this game as a routine rather than having fun with it since League of Explorers\", \"commentId\": \"30545\", \"commentDate\": \"1483651380\"}, {\"comment\": \"A good point there    Blizzard does take care of it all  Sometimes I have the feeling that leading streamers are told to show the preferred decks by the company  As a way to not play the meta try asian servers  I heard raynand complain a lot abt its unusual plays n missplays  There they try a lot of stuff in their decks    They try to be original NotLikeMe who undesrstands originality as putting Majordomo Executus in a secret  Barnes hunter deck as fun xd it is actually  if its not ranked\", \"commentId\": \"30546\", \"commentDate\": \"1483652459\"}, {\"comment\": \"Man its so simple even a

left in high ranked play   Until you stabilize aggression you have no choice what cards to play  And then when you DO stabilize the aggro decks just concede  Or you play control on control and whomever gets the luckier Dirty Rat wins   Furthermore  this is CLEARLY the direction Hearthstone is going  Its not an accident  You look at HOW MANY cards Blizzard has aimed lately at early game  curvestone and designs to stamp out any significant control presence  and you look at the cards Control decks will be losing with rotation  its just going to get worse  Blizzard wants Hearthstone to be a casual game  This eSports and competitive stuff is all created by the players  When you look at the support they give to games like Starcraft 2 and Overwatch to create competitive ranked play and frequent Meta shifts and compare it to Hearthstone the philosophy is plain as day those are their competitive games and Hearthstone is  as you said  the game to play on the toilet  When the only two remotely viable control decks have the grand and detailed strategy of dont die  draw cards  use combo to win   you know the strategic aspect has left Hearthstone\", \"commentId\": \"30548\",
