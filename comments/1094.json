"[{\"comment\": \"As someone with experience in data mining and predictive modelling  I can tell you that with access to Blizzards huge database it would be fairly easy to predict any decks win percentage against any other deck using a neural network or decision treetype model trained on their data  No need to write much of an algorithm the card base is finite and while there are a great many decks only the class and presence or absence of key cards within each deck would be enough to predict a winner on average with reasonable accuracy   its really not as complicated as you are making out   Your second paragraph is beyond bad logicwise  but for the record 1 The number of YouTube clips featuring people buying large numbers of packs has nothing to do with whether or not Blizzard would maximise their sales by manipulating the matchmaking algorithm  Corporates maximise profits for shareholders  How many such clips are there compared to the millions of accounts that Blizzard can potentially tap to buy a few more packs You do that math Einstein  2 Your assertion that you win games playing a deck from the current expansion does not counter the possibility that decks featuring older cards might be unfavoured in the match ups to nudge people into purchasing more cards to be competitive  Im sorry that you feel the need to play that broken Shaman shit  so good luck against the NZoth  CThun  CouncilmanZoo   and CoW hunter decks that ARE somewhat competitive against it\", \"commentId\": \"22832\", \"commentDate\": \"1468728396\"}, {\"comment\": \"This thread

 first three games were aggro shamans  with absolutely redicoulous openings  one of them was even spamming emotes after he played his second Spirit wolves whilst having the tunnel trog buffing up to a

skilled combo of rockbiter  doomhammer  once at 16 health  he plled off to get lethal with 5spells  if that just isnt enough  amidrange hunter was my next game who managed to get a call of the wild twice in a row  both topdecks  does anyone have a deck that counters aggro shamans im donewith this for now\", \"commentId\": \"22834\", \"commentDate\": \"1468745100\"}, {\"comment\": \"I had good success with Devine Paladin  Its a tempo oriented deck that is builded arround devine minions that are hard to remove  Usually an aggro shaman needs to trade with you  if you have an aggro deck yourself  but in this case its very difficult once the devine minions are rolling and he most likely will go face instead  due to ineffective removal  That will help you to gain board control and finish the job  Note that this is not a very common  nor known deck on ladder and as such it might be strange hearing that  But i have a positive winrate with it against shamis\", \"commentId\":

generally makes the matter worse in the long run  since you reward your own anger related behaviour  Letting your anger out is one of the biggest idiocies held alive by psychologically incompetent

bloodsail cultist and southsea captain synergy  some other quality cards  At the end he had no cards in hand  I had a pyroblast  My board was a 32 earthen ring  3 of his minions had 2 hp  one had 3
