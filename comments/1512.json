"[{\"comment\": \"Turn 7 lethal was just the average duration  In fact  it was a bit slow a kill  A face hunter who you did not cause much problems often killed you on turn 6  Its true  tho  that BRM face hunter was strictly slower than actual pirate warrior  because rarely  if ever  was able to kill you on turn 5  while these guys do it all the time  And its sad  because last time I saw such a thing was fucking huntertaker with their OP Undertaker startings  This pirate decks are imitating the absolute worst thing it might have ever happened to Hearthstone\", \"commentId\": \"31749\",
