 I honestly think Blizzard has a problem with admitting their mistakes  I dont think theyre gonna admit they fucked up big time when they tried to buff shaman  but instead made it absurdly broken  i dont think theyre gonna admit they fucked up the core of hunter face  I dont think theyre gonna admit they fucked up the amount of burst theyve given mage  I dont think theyre gonna admit they fucked up fiery win axe  So I dont think theyre gonna address these issues\", \"commentId\": \"27601\", \"commentDate\": \"1478266812\"}, {\"comment\": \"Nothing but Shaman  Shaman  only freaking Shaman

play at rank 18  Higher ranks are infested with them  and they have no counter  Not even Freeze Mage is good enough to be called a proper counter  Secret paladin meta was a joke in power level

is certainly a factor  playing enough games over an extended period of time law of big numbers removes the largest part of it and thats where skill comes in to play  If you only play a few hours a day

Malygos Druid  the constant problem when I come up against a priest is that they ALWAYS Entomb my Malygos the INSTANT I play that on the board IS THAT LEGIT NO If Blizz buffs Priest  the entire game
