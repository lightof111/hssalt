going to and concede and move on to the next game Thanks    Also  please let me know when my opponent has the Leeroy  PO  Abusive  Faceless combo  That way I can concede instead of controlling the board for the entire game while keeping my health above 25 at all times and lose the game to the NON interactive way you pride yourself of making this game    You nerf the Druid combo and do nothing to the Warlocks Hero power that can exploit bullshit like this  Well  I lost my 2 ranks for the day    I am fucking done with this bullshit game where skill is punished\", \"commentId\": \"21130\", \"commentDate\": \"1464956534\"}, {\"comment\": \"Praise Yogg Thats it  I give up  Ive uninstalled Hearthstone but Ive kept the collection simply because of the time and money invested in this game  This is the last time that I will post here until I get my life on track again this sounds bad when someone says it but it is not like my life is bad at the moment  It is in fact great  Im getting my masters degree this month so yey  things are going well  but continue reading pls  I will be completely honest with all of you about the reason that I quit  This game has brought me nothing but hatred  anger and misery in the last two and a half years  It shaped me into an extremely hateful and toxic person  something that Ive never been before  It killed most of my nerves  made me hate myself and my opponent and generally made me so salty that Reynad would be jealous at me  Im not saying that I didnt have fun playing it  Im a TCG veteran with over 15 years of experience and Ive played everything from pokemon which Ive played professionally and it earned me scholarship and some money to Magic a game which I simply adore but my wallet hates it more than Hearthstone  With such background it was only natural that I had to have fun with HS  right And I had fun  Hell  Ive played non stop when the open beta came and continued to play since then until now  However  Ive never played a single game in my life that made me this toxic  When I play other card games I am cool and I never get frustrated  It is just when I play HS  and I dont know why  Ive reached legend multiple times and it had cost me soooo much time and nerves  With the meta becoming more and more cancerous and us control and combo players getting more and more punished for trying to play a deck that requires more thinking than just going face  Ive became more and more frustrated  Today Ive reached my boiling point and decided that enough is enough  Ive started to hate the person that this game had shaped me into  So I give up for my own sanity the part that Yogg didnt consume  All in all  despite all the bad times I had with this game  there were many great times as well  I wish all of you the best luck in your future endeavors and may the RNG always be on your side \", \"commentId\": \"21131\", \"commentDate\": \"1464956584\"}, {\"comment\": \"I have come to the conclusion that the only way to stay sane with this game is to just play it once in a while  Make 35 games a day and that is enough  It works for me  The only times I play more than that is when I am high as fuck so when I lose I dont get angry ahahah\", \"commentId\": \"21132\", \"commentDate\": \"1464957034\"}, {\"comment\": \"When you lose to a yogg mage with 1HP AFTER iceblock popped but he topdecks Reno and the

man  I also uninstalled a couple of weeks ago I got salty in here whilst doing so but I inevitably reinstalled a few days later simply because it breaks up my day at work playing on my mobile  I must have uninstalled and reinstalled about 15 times now since I started about a year ago  I literally cant stand the game at this point  I can totally relate to what youre saying about the level of toxicity  Ive played numerous games at a competitive level including CS 1 6 and COD4 and I never  ever got anywhere close to the levels of rage I get to with Hearthstone  Theres just something about getting rekt by RNG in this game and some kid spamming Greetings at you and when you inevitably concede  you just know hes laughing on the other side  thinking that hes amazing and a better player etc  and that just makes me SO FUCKING MAD  Ive thrown my phone across the room numerous times  kicked the shit out of my surroundings after a bad game  shouted horrific lines of expletives  its ridiculous and I just wish there was a decent alternative to this game that I could fill my time at work with instead so I didnt keep going back to this piece of shit  UGH  Anyway  sorry  good luck
