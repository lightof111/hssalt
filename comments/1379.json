pushed way up by 2x dark peddler  which usually gave me turds like worgen infiltrator  and by 2x Abyssal Enforcer  an insane card that wins you the game  except when your opponent gets it for free off your deck by total random chance Then yes  you lose  Lol  Stupid garbage\", \"commentId\": \"28904\", \"commentDate\": \"1480900072\"}, {\"comment\": \"Like against the rogue  heres how he killed my coined councilman on an empty board on his turn 3 Ships Canon  into second swashburglar he had one as his one drop  hes good at hearthstone into hit the 15 with the coin toss Like  What is that shit  I cant play around an answer thats even better than Shadowstrike  the best possible answer already lol  This is the same guy who got Jaraxxus off his swashburglers The last game I lost to a priest who played azure drake  into talon priest  into bog creeper  bog creeper  88 dinosaur guy  into thoughtstolen enforcer into kraken Wtf is that  As a zoo deck  you cannot beat this kind of draw  The sheer fact that I killed that many giant minions while still pressing for damage is INSANE  but he finally got a free enforcer  which is like better version of the 3 damage priest clear  What Oh and I got an enforcer off his deathlord  which left only one enforcer at the bottom of my deck  Had I gotten it any turn in the 4 turns before I lost  I would have won  but it ended up being card 21\",

of playing all the jade cards and end up with an empty hand  a full deck  and only 11 golems on the board by turn 7  Ive had a few that get the train going  but mostly people dont realise its an attempt at a control deck  and try to play so greedy  Pirate on the other hand    literally brainless  You can drop anything you want  every turn  and still win by turn 56  I can see why they kept removing Patches from the game with every expansion  Its completely broken  and combined with the new cheap pirates that also have weapon synergy  its just created an absolutely bullshit wall of aggro
