almost any viable deck the RNG factor is important  you find that the most reliable source of ranks are days where you just get a good streak  Meanwhile  in other days youll not be able to do shit no matter what  With that in mind  we can say its a good thing blizzard already made ranks 15  10 and 5 checkpoints  I even got downgraded from rank 1 5 stars to rank 7 0 stars  Lets just say it was not
