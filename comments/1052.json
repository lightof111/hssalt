my greatest win of all time with my custom renolock  Was ahead the whole game  but my opponent golden portrait topdecked some ridiculous cards among some massive misplays  Played Jaraxxus as a hail mary play from 3 health and managed to just survive with 1 health opponent topdecked PO  but was at 8 health  I knocked off one of his minions and played rag as my final stand could of just survived another turn  but with my opponents luck I had no chance  He managed to hit face in 17 odds to grant me an amazing win   Real reason I was on here was to complain about the toxic casual decks  Was trying to finish a warlock quest so chucked together a renounce darkness deck and versed 2 golden heroes including our friend   with only midrange or aggro shaman  zoolock  hunter and thief priest I HATE PRIEST in about 10 losses in a row  So I raged  made up my own renolock deck and queued it   and that game   came after a further two losses\", \"commentId\": \"21948\", \"commentDate\":

Warrior vs YoggToken DruidI have the board  druid has 2 cards in hand and taking fatigue damage  1 of the cards he has is Yogg and 2nd wrath  He plays Yogg 5 secrets  Twisting Nether  2x Call of the Wild  Mindgames my Deathwing  gives him Blessed Champion  Seal of Champions and Charge  all 3 of those spells were cast having 1 in 7 chances since 2x Call of the Wild were in place already   He also played a bunch of other irrelevant spells that didnt affect the board  2nd game Yogg n Load Hunter vs Zoo I dominated the whole game  He has 4 hp and i got 21  I got burst down by Leeroy Jenkins  4x Power Overwhelming  Soulfire in 1 turn  Lately i rather watch Hearthstone or read about it than actually play it  Does anyone else feel the same way\", \"commentId\": \"21966\", \"commentDate\":
