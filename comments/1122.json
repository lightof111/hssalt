and board  he has two cards in hand  one of them yogg  He Yoggs  fills his hand with cards  kills my minions  he gets blood of ichor from it  then that slime gets Bane of Doomd and he gets fearsome doomguard from that  He gets a thoughtsteal and steals not only my tirion but my faceless manipulator   Like  why did they put this in the game I seriously cant understand it  To make it worse  my opponent BMs me hard after all his presents  I didnt get angry but I would rather lose to fairness and skill that Yogg  Id love to start a petition to remove him from the game\", \"commentId\":

Said  there should be better rewards for playing Ranked mode  Make it so you get 10 gold per win in ranked mode  I made a rule to myself that I wouldnt play Control Warrior in Casual mode  but i think its time to break that rule because Casual is extremely toxic lol  thats why Hearthstone for the most part is Tilting to play because you cant play any fun decks with running into tryhards in casual mode  This morning I was playing Dragon Reno mage   something i would consider a Fun deck  I know its not a proven deck but im playing Casual mode because there is no stress   However the first game    i play against znoth pally  and btw im probably 90 right on the deck  give or Take 1 or 2 card  So the salty person i am  After he beat me after playing double healing  I add him and This is how the convention went Me LOL what are you doing if youre gonna play Casual mode at least play something other than the most Cliche Znoth Pally list out there Him Mad Youre Shit  LOL I can guess this is what the a typical asshole like this  plays casual mode for quests and acts snide and doesnt look in the mirror  Blizzard Seriously needs to change their system  make it so Ranked has a better payoff my suggestions 1  dont make quests work in Casual mode  only in ranked and Tavern brawl 2  like i said earilier  make Ranked give you 10 gold for every win\", \"commentId\": \"23436\", \"commentDate\":
