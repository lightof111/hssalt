"[{\"comment\": \"Oh  well  good hearthstone day indeed  Face shaman gets turn 1 PRIEST hero power for some reason  but still beats me after adequate BM because even if hes doing inefficient plays all the time I still cant draw any of my healings or removals  CThun druid gets 2xWild Growth  2xDark Arakkoa  CThuns Chosen  2xSwipe  Druid of the Claw  Living Roots  and CThun without any additional draw  on curve  And then I get to see more face shamans with ultradraws AND a CThun Yogg druid that managed to get 50 of my health just with Living Roots and Power of the Wild because I everything I played was removed inmediately  then played Druid of the Claw  double Dark Arakkoa  Twin Emperors  Violet Teacher  and Yogg gave itself Charge just when he needed 9 damage to win  At least I could recover my rank after that\", \"commentId\": \"24840\", \"commentDate\": \"1472300222\"}, {\"comment\": \"What a load of crud  Not you or your explanation  But if its true   damn  I hope it is

so the idea of the game is to have all these cool legendaries face off against eachother in the lategame Blizzard No no no  thats the funny part  Weve added all these cool tempting legendaries to the game but youll never get to play them because youll die before turn ten Employee I really dont think people can be so terrible that theyll start playing decks that just go face just because they care about winning more than having fun Blizzard Haha  people are scumbags  youll see But seriously  which deck counters face and tempo decks  I thought NZoth pally would work but it doesnt at all\",

has just been one of the unluckiest weeks Ive ever had in hearthstone   I only play about 23 games a day so each game is a huge deal to me and losing to ridiculous luck really pisses me off   Ive had quite a few wtf kind of luck is this moments this week  but 4 games in particular really got to me and I need to vent  One game I lost in fatigue with my opponents Yogg played 4 bites and a shield block  giving him the health and damage he needed to beat me by 2 health in the fatigue game    Another game I lost to an anyfinnzoth paladin who was also running Yoggsaron despite only having about 78 spells in his deck   I had huge board that was difficult to wipe I cant remember specifics  but there were 2 highmanes and of course my opponents 3 spell yogg no joke happened to cast twisting nether twice  and I lost  A mage I played had no board while I had an infested wolf  abusive sergeant  and misha on the board   She was at 6 mana and played Servant of Yogg Saron who happened to play shadow madness on the infested wolf  letting her attack my misha  get the wolfs deathrattle  and then clear my board with a perfect arcane missiles  A different mage I played wouldve been dead to my board I had two 66 menagerie warders  a stealthed 66 stranglethorn tiger  and another stealthed 88 stranglethorn tiger  I also had savage roar in my hand while I was at a comfortable 26 health   But then my opponent got 3 frost novas from a cabalists tome  locking me out of options and letting her win the game  tldr RNGesus hates me with a passion this week\", \"commentId\": \"24855\",
