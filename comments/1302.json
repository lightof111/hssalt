{\"comment\": \"httpus battle netforumsenhearthstonetopic20744694747page1 This topic had statiostical data about matchmaking being rigged that i was able to see in June  Now the topic is gone  Why is that Why did they delete it People just stop fooling yourselves and start thinking  Its not random httphearthstone gamepedia comMatchmakingcitenote8 even here you can clearly see its not random but based on MMR  Even if they say its not based on cards nor class how can you even be sure Because they said its not We live in a society where were being lied by politicians  Scandals are all over the place but every time sth comes out they try to burden it under the carpet  If this world has tought me one thing is that you cannot fully trust people who have power obove certian things  Here is a proof i managed to find on hearthpwn Nope  this is not a whining thread   at least not yet  I think youre more likely to face the same class after you lost a game to that class and I do have some number to back it up   Heres how this started  I was playing Freeze Mage today  I lose to a CW instant concede after I identify it as CW and then I faced 4 CW in a row  This could be just a bad luck  but I wasnt facing any CW for past 14 games and Warrior only accounts for less than 8 3 my ranked encounter this month why I was playing Freeze Mage in the first place  So  the chance I face I would face a 5 Warrior is a row is like 3 94e6  which is like 1 in 2 5 million odd  So  I was a little suspicious and decided to take a look of my 4 months game records 1213 games  I downloaded spreadsheets from Google Doc where I keep most of my game records  saved them as csv  wrote a simple MATLAB program  and checked chance of facing the same class after losing to that class against that that classs overall encounter rate for that month    To my surprise  for all 36 comparisons 9 classes and 4 months  the chance of facing the same class after losing to that class is higher than overall encounter rate of that class   Some of them are very close while others arent  but nonetheless  for every 36 comparisons over 1213 games  above statement holds  \", \"commentId\": \"27318\", \"commentDate\":
