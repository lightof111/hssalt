"[{\"comment\": \"So they try to make the meta slower and instead of that  ppl play quest rogue  so everyone tries to kill them before turn 5 so they cant quest  Most probably  in some days this is going to be the most aggressive meta ever  so nice try blizzard but as usually you cant do shit to fix your games   Not to mention that the game is not f2p in any way anymore  even for people who prepurchased it is impossible to make over 2 decks  Classic blizzard  greedy aholes  what should be done is that everyone should not give them a single dollar for some months so they realize that most people try to enjoy the game and the pay to win aspect is killing the fun\", \"commentId\": \"34984\", \"commentDate\": \"1491761261\"}, {\"comment\": \"this game beame a face race     whoever vomits

latest expansion I can finally say Im done  The testing team is ass  Open a PTR or send PTR invites to the pros so they can test shit properly  So I guess the salt in my post is towards the team responsible for testing and the team responsible for agreeing to ship like this  The players who play the broken decks dont deserve all the hate  though I do question why would anyone have fun playing

matched with other players who are also using Wild decks  Taken from the blizzard site  Huh  thats weird though  You guys at blizzard  you mean the last four matches  all those Jade druids were also using wild and innovative decks Woah that settles it for me luckily pfew  Haha here I was getting worried these Jade Druids and Pirate warriors were the same unoriginal assholes from standard mode  polluting the wild fun mode  But nah Im fine now  Great to know that Ill always be matched up with people who are also using WILD decks Thank Blizzard for wild mode and its variety  originality  fun  Since I did not like standard as much anymore  even with the new cards  I love to take a break and play some wild fun stuff   Gee wizz  I cant explain how happy I am to still get rekt by the same

main issues I have with standard right now Rogue Quest It is to easy to complete and can be done to quickly  I am still confused why the first guy they play counts as playing a card with the same name when they hadnt played anything yet  Also  when you polymorph a guy into a 11 sheep  it stays a 55  Which is fine  but them casting Van Cleef and him being a 1313 or anything but a 55 is silly to me  Either their guys can be shrunk and buffed or neither  It shouldnt be all the good and none of the bad  Fix the first minion played or add another counter  Mage Quest From a creative stand point it is awesome  It creating an infinite combo is not  A large advantage is fine  crippling your opponent is fine  getting to do infinite damage to your opponentcreatures is not fun  The deck might be fun to play but it is miserable to play against  The quest and Time Warp are both fine  imo  The combo I would fix though to be an advantage not an insta win  Change Sorcerers Apprentice to say Reduce the cost of the first spell you play by one  This allows a combo turn for big advantage but not infinite damage  Shaman QuestRewardFunctionality Why is this one different than the others at getting counters There are a quite a few cards that put multiple murlocs into play  Overall  its probably fine but it seems weird for it to count stuff made like the card that makes four murlocs which gives four counters  The reward  Megafin  seems a bit over the top  Often times its  draw 710 cards  Seems a bit much to me  Meta Mostly rockpaperscissors  You need to play aggro to beat the combo decks like Rogue and Mage but lose to other aggro decks and the control decks like taunt warrior or priest  Play combo to beat the control decks but lose to aggro and play control and lose to combo  Its okay I guess but its a bit to extreme in the sense that there is no middle man  Because of this  decks like midrange Druid Quest for example  are non existent  Consistency Decks in general are just to consistent  Almost every games comes down to people having the same draw  with the same cards  It makes for a bit of stale gameplay when I can guess what my opponent is going to play each turn  Not to mention  that some decks can gets hands that are out right unbeatable at times  I would personally like to see the max deck size be increased to 40\", \"commentId\": \"34999\", \"commentDate\":

coldlight oracle and of course antonidas  As i play the combo here comes the rope and instantly I know Ive lost  I get down all the little girls and then trigger the time warp well 2 centuries later its in my hand for me to play but my turn is over and I come second instead of first in the tournament  Know there is no guarantee that I would have drawn antonidas Ill give you that  but why should my chance be taken away so a big ass clock can tick on my screen  Take out the animation  stop the rope while its playing I dont fucking know do ANYTHING so that players dont have to play around
