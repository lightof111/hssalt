tilting I just see black and I just want to release   no matter how legit the advice is I just dont want to hear it  But since Im currently not tilting and it wasnt directed to me I gotta say its nice to see theres compassion on hearthpwn after all  unless you were sarcastic or something P   OT Im so annoyed that everyone chooses mage in arena  Not that its an OP class but theres nothing more boring than to queue up against the same class 6 times in a row  And isnt it nice when one of them is a perfectly constructed mech mage in ARENA that gets all the synergies going and all the rng Guy played not 1  not 2  not 3 but FOUR mechwarpers  shredder  gorillabot  piloted skygolem and 2 fucking activated blastmages that connected perfectly to clear my board  Fucking ridiculous  Ofc its on my
