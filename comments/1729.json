card to its hand 23 times before youve even had a turn  and then you cant even use Dirty Rat to try and stop it  because for some stupid reason  it still counts as them summoning it  And infinite 55s that can bounce charge for 1 mana is just plain stupid  The quest needs nerfing  playing 4 of one type is too easy and can be completed within a few turns  Every other quest at least takes beyond turn 5 to complete and gives you a chance to play against\", \"commentId\": \"36264\", \"commentDate\": \"1493464140\"}, {\"comment\": \"dirty rat doesnt trigger the quest\", \"commentId\": \"36265\",

shenanigans  Druids pretty much dead  Pirate warrior is still a thing thank god for that  amirite  taunt warrior is  its whatever  Hunter has never been stupider fuck crackling raptor  Priest isnt even worth talking about  This on top of all the other randomdiscover mechanics  and you have a game that is basically just rng on crack  Why dont we just fuck the card game all together  and just make the winner whoever gets the fucking coin  Fuck you blizzard Oh also thanks for taking Danny Pudi  putting him in your videos and making him one of the most cringe worthy pieces of shit I have

add people  to be nice  and they either go  What or Yeah or flame me because I guess they think Im about to flame them  but I always just say GG  They then proceed to tell me how they expect to be

positive interactions  IDK how triggered I get when someone says What or Yeah  Fucking grow up  If we were playing face to face after the game and I stuck my hand out to shake your hand  IE a show of
