better used at a different spot Do I discover Tarim right now or do I rather take the 3 mana 43  because I need a taunt right now or I might fall to far behind  This are questions  that really determine how good you are  I remeber this one situation  where everyone in Kripps Chat said Flamestrike  Flamestrike  Flamestrike  but he played a monster instead  which his opponent ignored and went face  Next Turn he flamestriked him and had a monster in the field  which made his position way better  Of course his opponent missplayed  or not  because that is the questions in such a moment  But if he had flamestriked instead of playing the monster  his opponent would still have the field advantage of playing a new minion first  Situations like these determine  who is the better player\",

situations which renders some of your opponents cards useless or inefficient  Of course luck is a factor and some situations relies on you having certain cards but hell    most card games work like that  MTG e g  if you didnt draw mana to play your counter or didnt draw into any removal etc   I think people get mad because sometimes you lose and it seems that regardless of how well you played the loss was inevitable  and thereby thinks skill doesnt matter   E g  recently I played against a freeze mage as Silence Priest  and I was ready to go off but my board was frozen until I was bursted

the answers so to speak   The meta is very cut and dry right now and matchups often dictate who will probably win  Doesnt mean people dont make stupid plays  They do  Doesnt mean you cant help your chances of winning by making the best decisions  You can   Overall though  MOST games are definitely decided by stating cards  matchup  and subsequent draws   There is some basic math involved too    Getting legend is mostly a function of time invested and whatever hot deck you are using  No one gets legend using basic cards or a crappy deck  If it was mostly skill then players would be able to get legend consistently with just about ANY deck   But they cant and dont  Most legend players have reached that point simply by playing the powerful meta deck of the month  Like pirate warrior last month or maybe quest rogue this month  Many seasons ago players got legend with secret paladin  aggro shaman  whatever else was OP at the time  Thats how it works\", \"commentId\": \"35887\",
