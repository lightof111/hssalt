matchups yesterday were unfavored  but this game was retarded and i only remember the maelstroms  I was renolock with a great start including 410drake with shambler on 5 and i still needed to reno on 6  He was Aggrotard shaman  with also great toolscurve This fucking idiot rolls spll power and taunt on command litterally when needed  he needs to smorc ok  roll taunt  he needs to clear my tempo  ok spll dmg  After all this  Both maelstrom portals reward this genious with first and foremost pintsized buccaneer  and it was at 3 attack all game as he played a doom hammer next turn   get some balance back on board  Boom spll dmg plus azure plus thalnos flamestrike maelstrom minion from maelstrom      southsea deckhand  That game boys that  game is what is wrong with aggroshaman  their upside is fucking ridiculous and arent really any downsides seems broken that shaman continually gets tier one decks that cost nothing to play with  one of the reasons the removed patron was because it also cost basically nothing and was the best deck in the game  with a broken mechanic  Shaman doesnt have the broken mechanic  but the rest is lining up\", \"commentId\": \"30175\",
