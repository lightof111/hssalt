month ago  I undertood pretty fast all the mechanics and got so into it i am now following a lot of streams and yt channels  I decided a few weeks ago that as long as i had 150 gold id try an arena run   not a good idea tho  I win 23 times before other three players outplay me and thats so frustating  i draft always terrible classes and often bad cards  I downloaded heartharena and follow almost always the tips  Today i drafted a priest with terrible cards and I found2 aggro hunter  a mage do i have to add anything to make him look hard to beat and a druid who had perfect answers to my drops  I lost 13    I dunno maybe im just unlucky but im thinking about unistalling   Sorry for the bad english  every tip is very much appreciated\", \"commentId\": \"29441\", \"commentDate\":

in arena    If you like the style keep trying  its fun  My best run is still only 5 victories  but if you get to play arena well you get rly rewarded    otherwise play constructed which is quite  nice

use his weapons on your small minions saving your face from some damage  And then you can hopefully play your 4 mana taunts  Netherspite can also provide you with some taunts or an alextrasza for lategame heal  Of course  if he draws perfect or the Dragon priest draws bad  the warrior still can smash priests face in  But Dragon priest has a lot of tools to overcome the pirates  But taunt warrior should work as well Just that it sucks against other decks\", \"commentId\": \"29446\", \"commentDate\": \"1481541253\"}, {\"comment\": \"\", \"commentId\": \"29447\", \"commentDate\":
