wallet warriors    I mean control  Funny how people always rage at aggro decks when this single deck consistently demolishes aggro   Id prefer to lose to an aggro deck in 5 minutes and move on to the next game rather than losing to a control warrior after half an hour of him just spamming tank up and shitting out endless legendaries  How is that fun in any way  shape or form It doesnt seem fun to play control and its not fun to play against them either  Control vs control lasts like a bloody hour   When I kill control warriors  I feel good  Aggro  on the other hand  is easy as hell to kill     get one solid board clear against them and they instantly lose the game\", \"commentId\": \"23389\", \"commentDate\": \"1469867978\"}, {\"comment\": \"I dont understand how much balls you have to lack to play COntrol Warrior at 16  You can just make whatever shit plays and just topdeck your answers and acting like a wuss behind your army  Man up and take your risks   Im just playing against Cancer or that and I just cant win because no matter what I play they counter the shit out of me  I can usually reach 1213 but this meta is just fucking me over time and time again and it took me half the season to get out of RANK 20  THE WHOLE YEAR I HAVE BEEN PLAYING I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO BAD ON LADDER  I JUST DIE TO GUTLESS autopilot decks   You guys are complaining about how you guys cant reach legend because of cancer Here is a guy  who has been playing for a whole year  getting fucked over by perfect cancer decks  I saltfriended this aggro shaman after my 5th match against them and they say its fun because they win a lot of games and why should they take more effort to get the same win People with this mentality are probably robbers or on benefits in real life because of their affection for easy stuff   My message to cancer and Control Warrior  get some balls  Stop farming rank 20 for your free wins as if your deck isnt good enough to camp at rank 1 legend for the rest of eternity  and please stop pretending you are skilled\", \"commentId\": \"23390\", \"commentDate\": \"1469870638\"}, {\"comment\": \"Fuck off to all the fucking mage casters cabalist tomespammers and

mainly  If youre playing against a roguedruid you obviously want to try to squeeze in your heropower because they are very bad at restoring their health  Versus control warriors and priests you mainly want to go for a lot of value  For instance  I just had a game at rank 3 versus a druid  It was turn 7 and I had a Savannah Highmane   Stranglethorn Tiger   Huge Toad and Quick Shot   He had 11 health and a Violet Teacher and two 11s while I had no board  The most obvious play on curve would be Savannah Highmane but I went for Stranglethorn Tiger  heropower because I needed to pressure him down and he hadnt shown any Mulch or Wrath yet  He had shown a Feral Rage though  which they only run 1 copy off  Besides that he had already showns one of his Raven Idol s   Turns out that play won me the game  Now this example might be very obvious but it shows how you need to know decks their weaknesses and the cards they run if you want to play optimally and create a game plan  This applies to any deck\", \"commentId\": \"23394\", \"commentDate\": \"1469878144\"}, {\"comment\": \"Playing a 6mana cost on T7 isnt oncurve\", \"commentId\": \"23395\", \"commentDate\": \"1469880128\"}, {\"comment\":
