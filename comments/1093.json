for so many values  And you cant say a developper is bad just because he dont have knowledge in AI  As i said  thinking MM is based on deck construction is just pure salt  Also  they dont have to created a rigged MM for people to but their latest packs  Just look at all those youtuber buying 500 packs each month  do the math  and dont forget that other people buy packs with real money each days myself i buy the 50 preorder packs of each expansion Plus  if the MM is realy rigged  why do i win games with fun deck that dont need many gold to invest Aggro shaman  which is the deck you seems to think that is favored by a rigged MM doesnt cost that much barely 2 epics  so everyone can create it without investing that much  They want to lure new players to pay They gives us a free arena  about 300gold and few boosters at start  so its enough to earn the dust you need to build an efficient aggro deck\", \"commentId\": \"22813\", \"commentDate\": \"1468689175\"}, {\"comment\": \"So tired of ranked play  arena is pretty bad right now also  Going to take a very long break  I have tried so many decks the last two ranked seasons in standard  I refuse to play face decks its so boring  and playing vs aggro decks 95 of the time has gotten to the point I do not even want to bother doing my quest  Rank 5 is nothing but complete face cancer  I will wait to see if the next adventure will bring serious anti aggro cards or if tunnel trog is nerfed  he wont be if the next adventure does not have serious viable antiaggro tools I will be gone for a very long time   To be clear I want aggro to exist I think its awesome some people like to play that way  The problem is as a deck builder and someone who tries all kinds of things the antiaggro tools available right now are not even close to good enough you are always at the mercy of drawing perfectly and them drawing poorly\", \"commentId\": \"22814\", \"commentDate\": \"1468690989\"}, {\"comment\": \"Most cancerous cards ever

have a hard time believing that their developers are not top notch  HS developers have been able to make this game balanced in a way that very good players wont be able to dominate all the time  I think it naive to attribute everything to RNG and not realize that Blizz devs are actually good enough to make the game as balanced as possible  That includes being able to code in algorithms that wont allow certain deck types to completely dominate  As much as people think that Zoo and Aggro Shaman win all the time  Having being able to have played those decks myself  I can tell you that is not the case  They do have a higher win percentage than others decks in the current meta  but it is nowhere near a 70 win average in the complete season There are winning streaks  but in the complete month  Id be surprised to see that winning percentage\", \"commentId\": \"22817\", \"commentDate\": \"1468691573\"}, {\"comment\": \"Which retard at blizzard thought Cthun would be a good idea It usually is a 10 cost 1616 that clears the board and threatens lethal    What the fuck  Basically  if you are matched up with a 9 year old playing his Cthun insert literally any class and he plays Cthun and you do not have a removal    you lose  What part of that seems balanced And another thing is  Cthun is so fucking lame  every deck is pretty much the same even when its with different classes  so obviously morons who dont know how to play card games will play Cthun decks that they make  WOW as a way to avoid criticism for playing aggro  We seriously need a new card design team at

as much money as if they favored deck with mostly legendaries Woo thats a step  Now  Being  a top notch developper doesnt mean to be good in such algorithm  they should be mostly good at optimising a game which they seriously are not doing Blizzard seems to recruit mostly on experience and fresh ideas than over the top skills  And honnestly  i understand that  Plus a real good programmer wont be interested in major company since it can be limited for him And the balance isnt the job of the developper  Analysts are here for this  Balance a game like Hearthstone isnt making a deck having 50 win rate  thats impossible  Its making a card viable  meaning that players can find a way to play the card a way or another  You cant avoid some archetype to be dominating the game in such card game until next expansion  thats the way it works  Its almost the same as in League of Legend when some characters are Tier 1 or even sometime god tier until they release new chars and items making a rotation of played char  An example in HS Doomsayer  He had no play but in Freeze mage until recently when you see it in few controlmid range deck because he is efficient in the current meta  Saying that blizzard promotes deck is irrelevant since its the community that plays the decks  A youtuber or a pro player find an efficient deck and show it Everyone gets crazy and plays it if you dont   good for you  you are not a sheep and thats how the game works  So you should start realizing that a deck that have 50 win rates will never be played and thus will never exist\", \"commentId\": \"22819\",
