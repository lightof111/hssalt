backup plan whenever my connection goes down  I simply open up the 3g and use my phone as a hotspot so that I can continue the match in a the case a disconnect occurs from the Wifi and it was not connectable either  Like how fucking unlucky someone has to be for this shit to happen No matter how many times I did the emote greetings from the previous turns as in You lost mate There is no coming back from the match  fucking concede He would not I traded every single minion I had on board literally anticipating every single move leaving no open ends and having a board of 2x houndmaster both at 1 health  a hound on taunt with one health  and an infested wolf at full health  How fucking unfair and showing such unsportsmanlike conduct gets rewarded with a win Whats the point of ending turn

craft the damn expensive thing  anyways so i get matched up against 80 hunters which is annoying but they usually play like shit so my winrate is like 40 atm whatever cant do much  about that then i play against 2 aggro shamans in a row and lost both times to the exact same retarded shit  So it would go like this  im later into the game and stabilizing but low since the stupid deck shits out damage thinking its good trying to climb in armor and i have harrison ready for that retarded weapon  so the guy drops the weapon and hits for 4 face  harrison comes down i armor up and 2 times this happened back to back after i harrisoned their donghammer they topdeck another donghammer and had rockbiter in hand to kill me for 10  I get bad luck but the exact same thing by 2 different people happened 2 games in a row that honestly makes me feel like the game doesnt want me to go anywhere on ladder\", \"commentId\": \"24532\", \"commentDate\": \"1471839019\"}]"
