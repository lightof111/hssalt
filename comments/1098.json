homebrew Deathrattle hunter deck that provides mad early and midgame pressure and also fits in 2 Cotwild and NZoth for late game finishes  Ive had plenty of games where Ive got to turn 10 and not drawn any of the big three  Its frustrating when a hunter opponent gets 2 CoW before Ive been able to play 1  Hearthstone is very draw dependent  not all decks can carry reasonable draw mechanics\",
