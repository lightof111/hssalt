have basically every playable Legendary already  but it doesnt change the fact I miss quite a lot of them  So considering Legendaries are already very rare  how the fuck is this possible my last 5 Legendaries were 3 Fandrals and 2 Malygods Out of 5 Legendaries 4 were just a dust and thats all considering for someone who misses many Legendaries getting a double is quite hard to achieve  Wheres my Malorne Wheres Chogall Wheres Greenskin  Lorewalker Cho  Yshaarj  King Krush  Gruul etc  Theres bunch of Legendaries I still dont have  yet Im only getting doubles  Also  2 fucking years in Hearthstone  shit tons of packs opened  when Im going to be finally blessed with a single golden Legendary Yeah  not a single once since I started playing the game  And people get like 2 in 50 packs  Really fair\", \"commentId\": \"23311\", \"commentDate\": \"1469739172\"}, {\"comment\": \"Because there is simply no way anymore for new players to get anything done and i mean anything  if there wouldnt be cheap decks that actually can keep up with the more expensive ones  Why Ask the people that sit right at rank 20 and stomp you with their golden heros and their crazy decks  Thats why  I mean i dont play in those ranks anymore  but i know some people that cannot progress in any way because of that and i understand them\", \"commentId\": \"23312\", \"commentDate\": \"1469742772\"},

these cheap decks  The idea behind buying expansions and packs is so you you can compete at high ranks  Those who dont should have to grind  They are not putting in the cash flow that keeps the game afloat  As a matter of fact  HS is more forgiving to the free player than any app I have seen  It does not take much to put together a zoo deck or some Hunter bullshit  These decks are winning a lot  They are beating expensive control decks and dictating the meta  The game is more about going face than competing with the board  You know what Fuck the freeloading new guy  All I give a shit about is keeping my average above  600 which is tilting hard with all of these face fucks\", \"commentId\": \"23318\", \"commentDate\": \"1469751013\"}, {\"comment\": \"If youre consistently filling the board

Pallys being secret  What happens I start queueing Priests up the ass  If I hit a Pally  its Murloc or a divine deck  Or it will be Hunter or a Mage but then I dont draw EoS  So basically playing control Pally is a pain in the ass at the moment  Ill stuff every board clear I can in a deck to counter aggro face face face face face face fuck face fuck your face with my face deck fuck but do you think Im lucky to have the combination I need when I need it No  because fuck you right If I didnt have such an addictive personality to this shit I would fuck this game with a chainsaw by running it through every device I own  I dont give a fuck  I hate this game  I pray one day that I wake up and either A my HS addiction is gone or B I sign on to see the message Sorry  Hearthstone is no longer here because our developers got fucked by an asteroid  Either way  this shit needs to go\", \"commentId\": \"23324\", \"commentDate\": \"1469758060\"}]"
