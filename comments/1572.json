some point he played Kabal Courier and managed to get Coldarra Drake so he had a hero power he could use as many times as possible  As you can imagine it was game over as soon as he started using it The thing that made me salty was the rope just kept burning and burning and his turn never ended so he was able to destroy all my minions  do some BM damage to himself and kill my hero  Thats obviously a combo thats never meant to happen and Im wondering if I should report it to Blizzard or if it was such a fluke that it will never happen again\", \"commentId\": \"33023\", \"commentDate\":

combo decks  Lame       Two token cards that create a Jade   Not even copies   And Auctioneer is more broken in Druid than it ever was in Rogue   but playing Innervate and Jade Idol on top of it is apparently too skill testing to rotate it out   Like  I dont even care that the deck isnt that great almost anything can tempo it out when they dont high roll into Innervates or get three Auctioneer draws on turn 5   People complain about it because its just stupid design   the Jade mechanic is not fun or interesting  and its going to be very lame if theres this interesting new Quest mechanic but the mistake expansion that was Gadgetzan holds it down because of Pirate Warrior winning on turn 5 and Jade Druid vomiting 1 mana 1515s\", \"commentId\": \"33026\", \"commentDate\": \"1488512892\"},

game is waiting on Auctioneer  And even if you do get rolling in the infinite Idols  by that time nobody gives a shit because youre either already way ahead or about to die   Even so  Idol is bullshit by default and no card should have that kind of ridiculous value  That Shielded Minibot from back in the day doesnt seem so OP now  does it\", \"commentId\": \"33027\", \"commentDate\":
