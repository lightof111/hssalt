First one I just cant understand how can someone say midrangeface shaman requires any brain cell at all  Today I saw some so bad  one of them wasted a Skillbiter Weapon on his Argent Squire to kill a turn 2 Kings Elekk    yes  your eyes arent fooling you  thats what I said  Good thing that piece of mouthbreathing scum didnt won  but the mere idea that with misplays like that he still was close to beat the crap out of me is just insulting  I actually expect shaman gets nothing but a bunch of worthless totems and maybe a onlycontrol or murloc card in the next expansions  because even in TGT it was bullshit remember the only reason why nobody played shaman in TGT was secret paladin being OP as hell and completely raping totem shaman  Second one Made an amazing mage arena deck  with 2xFlamestrike  big removal  lots of Faceless Summoners  and a strong early play thanks to mechs  Something really 73 worthy  maybe even 12  End the run at 33 because I draw like shit or find even crazier control mages  And apparently whenever I had to play Fel Reaver because Im in a topdeck war  I have to burn automatically my whole deck  starting with Flamestrikes and Faceless Summoners

shadowstrike in my hand  I was so focused on the damage total that I forgot about him  I played Leeroy  5 minions on my side of the board and yeah   both juggles went in my face and I lost   I did win
