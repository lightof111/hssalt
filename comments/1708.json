Glacial shard 4 times in a row  and completely fucked my board  This deck is not unbeatable  but its cancer  I dont know why do we need these pathetic decks in every fuckn expansion  Its the same like

a 1 4 Gb patch to address Minor text issues they should try to fix those Arena rewards    Im sick and tired of getting damn common cards as rewards after 7 wins    My last 3 runs were 9109 and I always got a damn useless common card It wasnt even golden I understand that you cant always get a shitload of gold or 2 packs but I find 5 dust to be just plain offensive     Also  why on earth are you able to get any quantity of gold ending with 5 It pisses me off tremendously    You either give me a way of using that 5 gold i e  to buy discounted Wild Packs or you just remove it completely

complain guys  Once the new expansion comes up everyone will buy it and Blizzard will continue the same practces  This team looks as if they are learning to develop a game on the go  They allow a class to play two 1 mana chargers with 55 and one that jumps from your deck for free on turn 5  Then they manipulate your board by returnng your expensive minions at your hand and they swarm again the board with 1 mana chargers  Seriously I played like 20 games and lost almost all of them  Broken plays all around  Then you play against mage which has access apparently to 5 ice blocks from random draws  Or against priest who now can choose which card he wants to draw from his deck and make a 1212 by turn 4 while having every answer against your minions  I dont even want to start with the pirate warrior who can kill u by turn 6 if you cant raise a wall\", \"commentId\": \"35830\", \"commentDate\": \"1492860985\"}, {\"comment\": \"Also  Paladin in Arena is so overpowered and broken  The

point the only appeal of HS to me is to take a weak deck  In this case  Malygos rogue in Wild  and go up against the top tier decks and see if them being piloted by absolute retards allows them to lose  Just got a Quest rogue who completed their quest by turn 4  Turn outs  having 2 of those 12 elementals and one of the 23 that gives off mana 12 elementals is a pretty good starting hand  and burnt my Malygos  my Thaurissan  and 2 Azure Drakes  And only those cards  not other  less important ones  obviously  They also burnt a few toxins from Xaril the poisonned mind  but hey  that was just a bonus  right  thanks to grimscale oracles  but still managed to lose by   Trading 2 for 1  1 of which was a 12 elemental  so pretty worthless  but the other was Patches  played from hand specifically to trade  despite there being other  less valuable minions on the board already to absorb the trade  into my minion WITH THE QUEST LITERALLY IN THEIR HAND  basically denying them 2 55s instead of 1 for no reason at all   Sending Thalnos back to my hand instead of killing it  giving me additional burst for lethal    Why is this in the salt and not pepper thread  Because these morons manage to reach rank 10  Rank goddamn 10  This shouldnt be possible  The dumbing down of this game has reached absolutely insane levels where someone that clueless can reach rank 10  And yes  I know  thats not much of an achievement  but neither is understanding that trading several minions when theyre 11s while next turn theyre gonna turn into 55s is really stupid\", \"commentId\": \"35832\",

corsairs that remove 1 durability from a weapon just to see what effect they have  My next match is a priest  then a Druid running the corsairs  then 3 fucking pallys  so fucking rigged to create even matchups or fuck knows what  but that is not random  I give up on Pally for a bit and try some beast hunter and face hunter  All of a sudden the matchups are predominantly hunter  Its just so fucking
