flip to 15  Been playing a basic tauntcontrol warrior deck and doing actually pretty well   Then I get an Aggro Druid who has over 40 damage on the board by turn 4   Well shit  Then a Quest rogue who finishes the quest on turn 2  preps it out on 3  and has lethal on 5   Never stood a chance  Then I switch to Midrange Paladin and draw another Quest Rogue   Finished quest on turn 4 and preps it out  finishes me on turn 5  Then I switch to Quest Rogue and get utterly demolished by a Pirate Warrior  Then I switch to Pirate Warrior and am up against a quest rogue   I NEVER DRAW ANY WEAPONS THE ENTIRE GAME   No upgrade  no Znoths first mate  no fiery win axe  no arcanite reaper  nothing   Theres 8 out of 30 cards that can get me a weapon   I actually lasted in this game until turn 11   I also mulliganed 3 of my 4 cards to start and picked up two draws in there   Thats 11  3  2  16 out of 30 cards I saw and not one was a weapon    My luck cant be that bad twice  Ill just stick with Pirate Warrior   Another quest rogue   Oh sweet  I should crush this guy   He beat me on turn 6 without me ever drawing a weapon   Well shit Back to Quest Rogue then   Paired with Pirate Warrior  he plays NZoth and coins out Southsea on turn one  Fiery War Axe on turn two  the game is effectively over on turn 4   FACK Fuck it  back to taunt warrior  that was working   I draw elementaltoken shaman   He loads the board  I brawl it away   The NEXT FUCKING TURN he loads the board with 5 more minions   I topdeck brawl and wipe it out   The next turn he LOADS THE BOARD with 4 more minions   I pay 3 taunts Stonehill  Public Defender from Stonehill  Alley Armorsmith   He devolves them and clears with minions   I play another Alley Armorsmith and another Stonehill Defender  drawing another Alley Armorsmith   He devolves them again and clears   Hes basicaly out of cards now  hes had 1 card hes been holdin on to  which Im sure is either Hex or Bloodlust   I play the third Alley Armorsmith  he hexes it and hes now got a board full of totems and shit   I topdeck into nothing useful  he summons a totem and skips his turn   I again topdeck into nothing  he plays two blood lusts and finishes me off   FACK Ok lets try Aggro Druid again   Paired up with     Warlock  Yes  Warlock   He soulfirehellfires EVERYTHING I drop  then plays a Doomguard that summons TWO SILVERWARE GOLEMS   Fuck it   Concede  Sticking with Aggro Druid  Im up against a Quest Rogue   Ok  this should be good   Hes sacrificed everything to keep my board clear  I topdeck into Living Mana on turn 5   Sweet  I play it   He topdecks Vanish on turn 6   FACK  I topdeck Innverate   FACK  He plays the quest   I topdeck another innervate   FAAAAAAAAAAAAACK I know Im on tilt at this point  so I know Im misplaying here and
