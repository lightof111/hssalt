fucking month off after todays fucking stupid shit Build a really fucking good mage draft in arena  get to 4  0  easily ahead on turn 6  I would have won in 2 turns max  Blizzard decides to disconnect me from battle net  internet still online  everything else still online  just disconnected from battle net  I kill the hearthstone process as quickly as possible and reload it  it doesnt even attempt to reconnect me to the game  it just counts that as a loss even though no more than 40 seconds had passed Get to 6  1  have an absolutely amazing opening hand  on turn 2 I have 3 minions on the board after clearing my opponents minion  Blizzard AGAIN FUCKING DECIDES TO DISCONNECT ME FROM FUCKING BATTLE NET  This time I kill hearthstone and reopen it in under 30 seconds  NOPE  blizzard says  YOU LOST THAT GAME Absolute fucking bullshit  I ended up going 10  3 when I should have fucking gone 12  01 After that stupid shit I give it a break and come back later  start a Rogue draft havent had the option the last 8 times in arena  make a pretty good deck  complete with fel reaver and good early curve  I even have some heavy hitters if things go pear shaped  My first match is against a warrior  who I am absolutely destroying UNTIL HE PLAYS NOT ONE  NOT TWO  BUT THREE FUCKING OBSIDIAN DESTROYERS ONE AFTER THE OTHER  Complete with fucking 2 executes to take out all my big minions I am now 0  1  I got unlucky  sure  I match up with a Druid    it should be smooth sailing  an arena druid that is 0  1  The fucking bullshit cunt has a Wild constructed Beast druid fucking deck  He plays 2 Haunted Creepers  2 Mark of YShaarj  a Living roots  and a Savage combatant in the first 5 turns  How in the fuck does this fucking bullshit cunt have 1 loss    how the fuck am I getting matched up with this at 0  1 I make the best of it and get to 5  3  Blizzard decides that I dont want gold at all from my arena rewards  instead they gave me 2 packs 1 old gods  1 tourney and a measly bit of dust  which pissed me off even more I still had enough gold to keep going though so I start a warlock draft  and I though this warlock draft was the fucking bomb  it has all the best  strong arena cards for lock  Ive lost countless times to decks just like this  2 Dark Peddlers  2 Darkshire councilman  imp gang boss  zombie chow  abusive  hellfire  bane of doom  2 voidcallers  2 dread infernals  fearsome doomguard  Its well balanced  has plenty of early game with enough late game threats First game I get matched up against a warrior and I mulligan my entire hand because I only had 4 and 5 drops and I get back 2 5 drops  and 1 6 drop  My first draw is a 6 drop  15 of my cards are 3 cost and under  My next draw is a 4 drop  Of course while this is all going on the warrior over there is playing minion after minion  When I can actually play something that trades well with his board  he of course has an execute in hand  He then proceeds to have ridiculous answers to absolutely everything I drop  Everything  Does my minion trade into both of his Yes   well not anymore because he has abusive  Again Dark Iron Dwarf this time  Again Inner rage  Again Weapon  Again Another Dark Iron Dwarf When I finally start getting some kind of control despite being under 15 health he drops an obsidian destroyer  because apparently every fucking warrior draft gets multiple obsidian destroyers every fucking draft  I manage to kill it in a really ugly way over 2 turns with Infernal  then soulfire  bane of doom  and I get some luck for once  Bane spawns illidan  Not so lucky though because he has a 2 attack and a 3 attack minion on board that trades perfectly But wait a minute    he doesnt take the trade He goes face  I am then able to take out 2 of his minions  and basically fill my board up  Tomb spider even gave me a taunt to play  He has the opportunity to trade into the illidan again but doesnt  And because he didnt make the simple trade to begin with I am able to clear his board with all the 21s I have  Basically he played like shit and could have secured the victory 2 turns ago by making the smart trade  instead he is about to lose He has no cards  he top decks korkron elite which he suicides into my taunt minion  I have 3 HP left  With everything on board I get him to 1 HP   1 HP  I was 1 off lethal  I searched for lethal with tomb spider and dark peddler  No charge or taunt from the spider  no soulfirepower overwhelmingstonetusk boar from the peddler  Next turn He top decks Fiery Win Axe  Not only that  he BMs and Ropes before revealing that is the FUCKING ABSOLUTE PIECE OF SHIT FUCK OFF CUNT PRICK SHIT CUNT FUCKING STUPID PIECE OF SHIT card he fucking top decked after playing like a fucking noob I am just so fucking done with this game  100 RNG  Doesnt matter
