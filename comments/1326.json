"[{\"comment\": \"Heroic General Drakkisath is the absolute worst This is easily the most unpleasant experience for me in Hearthstone thus far   Being able to play two minions per turn over your one is somewhat challenging  The other factors make this ridiculous Kidnapper synergy that you cant duplicate because of your one card limitation  and is just so frustrating to deal with  because hes eliminating your minions and outnumbering you with one card  Twisting Nether reset button every time you start to get some momentumImmediate elimination of lucky first turn threats eg I play KelThuzad  which he immediately crushes with Drakkisaths Command Theres also the same dialogue over and over again  and the amount of time you spend watching him draw cards from casting sprint  All of these factors together are forcing me to play this boss over and over and over again until I get lucky enough for a very particular set of cards to work just the right way   Decks loaded with big minions and legendaries  decks with KelThuzad and taunts  decks with Majordomo Executus and Mind Control  everything is crushed   At some point I will get lucky and this will be over   Until then  I dont understand how this came to be   Its not fun  its just grueling   Im not going to get better from playing this  Im just going to get lucky and move on with my life    Oh hey look I got KT and a Mind Control Force Tank to stick  and he didnt cast Drakkisaths command  maybe this will beDouble Flame Strike Hey dude  dont worry  he doesnt cast twisting nether when its just KTHe just did   But I resurrected him  and then he killed him with a Boulderfist and a flamestrike\", \"commentId\": \"27807\", \"commentDate\": \"1478894636\"}, {\"comment\": \"Sick and tired of this game     EVERY
