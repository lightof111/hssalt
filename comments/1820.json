 Tier 1 Jade Druid no variation of this is acceptable  Having infinite cards and drawing half your deck in a single turn isnt fun or skillful  Quest Mage potentially infinite damage that you cant do anything about when they have the required hand  Quest Rogue watching someone shuffle cards back and forth then charging face  Pirate Warrior most mindless deck in the game that works far too often  Freeze Mage stall  stall  stall  Alexstrasza  face spells  never interactive  AggroEgg Druid just as bad as Pirate Warrior  No thought process  just cheese out wins on turn 5 or less  Murloc Paladin basically an aggro deck in disguise  Putting Stonehill Defender in doesnt make it less oppressive  Tier 2 Midrange Hunter nearly every single one is the same  very little strategy to play and play against  Quest Warrior fine to a point  but once they complete the quest its coin flipping  BurnDiscover Mage same as Freeze Mage  the common tactic is throw spells at face and then discover more for face  Secret Mage Ive always liked Mage secrets  but this one is so heavy on tempo that they can cheat out a ridiculous board presence on early turns  Silence Priest again  you can create a ridiculous board presence before turn 5  and can win with dumb inner fire OTK  Evolve Shaman doppelganger  evolve is a busted combo  and getting a loss from a bunch of crappy minions plus bloodlust isnt skillful\", \"commentId\": \"38174\", \"commentDate\": \"1496025366\"}, {\"comment\": \"You can tell that hes running a Reno control deck though  which should absolutely be a counter to aggro  but
