enough to gain so much tempo  that the only thing i can do is to lean back and watch my remaining life go down to 0 i feel like a freekill    hey yo  yes you there you want a free star on your way to

game i had I meet a SMOrc shaman  nothing too fancy  just perfect curve buccaneer into patches  into flametongue  into coin 4mana 77 then i stabilize getting a voidwalker from a dark peddler  healing for 4 before  So  im sitting on 13 life  after trading into his buccaneer and siphoning his 4 mana 77  i just cannot reno cause he has  still tons of dmg  i have to risk it  but i feel pretty confident You know what he played a fucking maelstrom portal and got a leper gnome  then he goes like this double lava burst  1 dmg from the 11 totem rng then trades his leper gnome into my minion for the extra 2 dmg  Reno looking at me in my hand like WHAT DAFUQ Fuck you aggro shamans  you useless brainless idiots  Make me wanna quit this game Fun fact i had to play before this an UNBELIEAVABLE game against a Reno Mage where i just had to do miracles to win after 20 mins  then this  So  lesson for all of you you may need half an hour  to win  and less then 6 turns to lose\", \"commentId\":

still win  there are other decks out there  etc   But  the fact that stealing peoples shit is a feature of the class is just unfun garbage    Remember when Blizzard start thinking about how unfun it was to lose control of your character in WoW  Hearthstone reminds me of that time  at least spiritually   Theres just a ton of stuff that is super fun if youre doing it but super aggravating if youre having it done to you and that strikes me as poorly thought out\", \"commentId\": \"29932\", \"commentDate\": \"1482371718\"}, {\"comment\": \"Im not saying every mulligan puts Patches in my hand  Im

arena draft ever  The most obvious major weakness is the small number of 2 drops  I went 23  playing against 3 mages  a priest  and another warlock  In 4 of my 5 games  I missed my 2 drop  and in my 3rd game  I missed my 2 and 3 drop  Top this off with terrible Fel Cannon RNG  and you have a potential 79 win run cut far too short  To make this worse  all of my gadgetzan arena drafts have been below average and my arena runs have been below my WoToGKarazhan average of 4 or 5 wins  My fourth game stands out as the prime example of lopsided luck in arena  My mage opponent went second  T1 Mana Wyrm I miss my 2 drop  T2 Sorcerers Apprentice I play Imp Gang Boss  T3 frostbolt and ping IGB I play Fel Cannon  it hits the imp  The game completely snowballs from there and I die by turn 7
