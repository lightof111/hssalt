"[{\"comment\": \"I very very rarely play ranked anymore because I cant handle the frustrating meta and I might break my phone next time I lose to some bullshit  I decide to queue up with my own midrange hunter deck featuring Dinomancy and Volcanosaur  among others  because fuck it  I like those cards and I find the deck fun to play  First match  rank 21 i queue up against quest freeze mage who ropes literally every turn  including mulligan draw  Why do people do this Do they just immediately hate me because im playing an archetype they dislike Is it some sort of method people use to tilt your opponent into making bad decisions\", \"commentId\": \"36514\", \"commentDate\": \"1493836653\"}, {\"comment\": \"Lmao ok so youre even dumber than the tattoo suggested\", \"commentId\":

distressed when thinking about classic cards being rotated and i thought about my favorite carddeck ever  namely the miracle rogue I am fucking afraid of auctioneer being rotated because of it being the core of miracle rogue since the very beginning and it also being used in some other decks Then i came across this guy and i became even more distressed If my 2 golden auctioneers ever get rotated

with 1 or 2 stars and ended the day with 0 stars  I got to rank 14 twice today and Im currently sitting at rank 15  0 stars  I dont know what Im doing wrong  Im playing most of these decks properly  but Im losing more than half of my games  Ive had maybe two win streaks in 2040 games  4 days ago  I was sitting at rank 4 and the games didnt seem particularly difficult  I knew that  if I had a few more days to grind  I could hit legend  Now  I cant stay past 0 star rank 15 for longer than a couple games at a time   I never shouldve preorded ungoro and I never shouldve picked up Hearthstone again after so many years  This is pretty much the only game I play that I regularly feel hatred for  Every moment Ive played Hearthstone in the past two days has been a complete waste of my time\",
