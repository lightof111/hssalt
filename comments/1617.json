certainly there   Most seasons I mess around with multiple original builds trying to get to around rank 10  A bad season Id max out at 12  A good one 10    Make a Hunter deck with some big taunts  Make a warlock deck using all the demons  Make a warlock deck with double twisting nether  tharasion and jaraxus  Make a Pally deck using anyfin  Make a Priest deck using confuse  shadow word horror and cabal priest  Make a Pally deck using both rags  Make an evolve Shaman  Make a zoo deck using all charge minions  I just try to come up with some interesting builds around some sort of theme without using cards I despise  like Yogg or Thoughtsteal  I have a very large card collection  nearly all golden heros and more than 10000 ladder wins      I get salty losing all the time to more efficient netdecks that Ive seen literally 100s of times in a season  BM emotes tilt me especially hard  like  fuck  Im actually trying something different which must be giving my net decking Renolock opponent an interesting match for once instead of me being yet another Jade Shaman or pirate warrior  What do I get sulking rope if my deck wins through surprise  and mocking wows and well played when surprise they drop Reno or Drakonid takes a Rag  I end up despising people automatically if they play a top tier meta deck\", \"commentId\": \"33959\", \"commentDate\": \"1490155935\"}, {\"comment\":
