"[{\"comment\": \"A friend of mine has Hearthstone and plays super casually a game a week or so with a garbage collection  I often like helping him while he plays in class because teaching Hearthstone is actually fun and I get to have a firsthand experience of the new player experience  He floats between rank 20 and 18  Thats not that weird  because hes a new player and has a garbage collection right  So I help him identify the right plays to get higher  But the opponents we meet there are ridiculous  Sometimes we meet some other new player with a weird deck and we have a lot of fun  But I swear to god you meet top tier netdecks on rank 19  100 netdecked pirate warrior  jade shaman  renolock  you name it  What are those top tier decks doing at that rank Honestly\", \"commentId\":
