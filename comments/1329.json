"[{\"comment\": \"Yeah  Yogg is bad now  right Well guess again  Against tempo mage  Im at almost full HP  he is easily within my Malygos burst range  except it is my only and last card  But then of course  2 cards in hand  Yogg comes into play Frost Nova  Shatter my giant  kills my drake  fills his board with spiders  deals damage to my face  casts Soul of the Forest  heal his face with 7 targets on board at this point  casts Beneath the Grounds Of course all Nerubians are drawn before my Malygos  l  no problem  with double Moonfire and double Living Roots  I can kill him  EXCEPT NOT  because his fuckin Babbling book gave him exactly Ice Block the turn before  and with all the Nerubians and Yogg on board he has lethal  Next game  Shaman with double trogg  double feral spirits  I died on turn 5 with not a single answer  Followed by a tempo mage  perfect curve  hits his missiles  double arcane blast with thalnos  I died on turn 5 as well  And these were my first 3 games today  ALL of them BMing  right after they win by pure luck and perfect curve  They play bad  I cant punish  they get rewarded  they BM  No one else is even CLOSE to being as unlucky as I am  Think Amnesiac was unlucky against Pavel in that one game You dont even know what real consecutive unluck is  I really dont want to say my RNG is rigged  because thats obviously stupid  so the only reasonable explanation is that theres a higher life force that hates me and makes the impossible come to reality sarcasm\", \"commentId\": \"27870\", \"commentDate\": \"1479127218\"}, {\"comment\": \"I feel you
