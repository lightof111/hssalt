grind for the daily quest and coin limit but now its like lose lose lose  I am matched against ppl who has cards equivalent to a fucking legendary player  Fuck you Blizzard  Every match seems like a

because people are going for stress free quest rewards  You will also get the folks trying out new deck ideas  but those can sometimes be stronger decks as well  Also casual doesnt allow you to work on your golden hero portrait wins   My take on casual is to only use it for testing out new decks while at the same time expecting you will come across the typical aggro and net decks you see on ranked  The upside is that if you actual beat these decks  then maybe your idea is actually good\", \"commentId\": \"24811\", \"commentDate\": \"1472244041\"}, {\"comment\": \"to the motherfucking
