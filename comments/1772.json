\"First of all  The Caverns Below is a painfully bad design  and whether its OP or not doesnt have anything to do with that  The fact that it is OP just means this shit card affects more decks  Secondly  its easy to incorrectly determine the power of a card before its tested and the community doesnt have the power to test cards before theyre released  Now that Ungoro has been out for a while and Caverns has had its negative effect on the meta  the community can definitely pass judgment   Third  Caverns was not called the worst quest  what morons were you talking to People said it wouldnt be that great  and people also said it would be extremely powerful  but nobody said it was the worst quest  That was always The Last Kaleidosaur\", \"commentId\": \"37170\", \"commentDate\":

make stupid assumptions and dont be an asshole to people venting on the salt thread  I actually did have a great deck drafted went 63 but shouldve done better  but it was a slower deck and he had

technically was a more optimal line  not like holy shit that cost you the game  but I guarantee you not to where I should be stuck at this rank   I regularly hit 5 when I put in an effort  and never
