It could be a LEGENDARY and people would still play it  I just lost a game against priest that played 4 FOUR Drakonid  stealing 2 Hex I only had one and twice White Eyes  while I cannot even draw mine Blizzard killed miracle rogue and OTK decks because they were not fun  honestly WHY ON EARTH is  should be fun losing just because YOU DIDNT DRAW YOUR CARDS CUZ YOURE TRYING TO PLAY A CONTROL DECK IN

sided magic draw starting hand day I feel like Im constantly fighting a boxing match vs a guy with metal plates on his gloves and Im tied to the corner  Disgusting  Had losing streaks  but nothing like that  I was only rank 14  where Ive been since my comeback mid October  yes less than two months ago  after only having played this around 3 months in 2015  Dusted wild stuff too keep up  did get good stuff from playing cheap CThun decks on standard  Quickly got my initial rank 15 milestone  but played mostly casual due to be faster IMHO to farm gold there  Purchased some packs  Kara  LoE  unlocked Emperor wing on BRM and prepurchased MSG  I was having fun with this game  Had my bad times  had my lucky times too  But since late yesterday till now ITS A FING HELL  Dropped 4 ranks  Get hand with mid game cards  discard to get late game ones  Opponents have perfect starts  I get to watch and to serve them  Barely have a chance to make a decision  See tons of missplays on the other side  but then the draws fix everything for them  Doesnt matter if I play Druid  Shaman  Mage    Doesnt matter if its a Jade or a CThun deck    Everything gets crushed  even the cancerous Mid Range Shame Man looks like a feeder today  Even the very few I won  they were boring stomps too  I dont want to be stomped or even stomp all the time  I WANT FUN AND FAIR GAMES  WHY ME Im a Blizzard fanboy  like this style of game  only abandoned it last year cause I couldnt keep up  Gave it another try  loved it  now could even afford to become a pleased costumer  So JUST F STOP THIS BS OF SCRIPTING MY GAMES  BECAUSE THIS DOESNT FEEL RANDOM AT ALL  Makes no sense this being happening  Im no one special to be targeted by something like this  but the truth is THIS IS HAPPENING\", \"commentId\":

that right on the first word   wtf is going on    why am i forced to play  a specific deck just to feel that am capable of wining while 80 of every turn is decided by RNG  iskill will always matter but that infamous mage 3 drop for example when he is in the mood to toss fireballs on every target with perfect precision for example skill will not salvage ur turns and many more crap like that    i wonder if hearthstone will see some kind of balance ever again    its a shame i really like the game but it just feels like a busy school night with lots of homework to finish rather than taking a
