see who wins or loses next turn based on this 4 minute sequence of spells       The entire game  no matter how well or poorly played is literally decided by a random sequence of spells  Awesome design Blizzard  This is the expansion of big  dumb cards that are frustratingly limiting in deck creation  Play a ton of CThun cards and win or lose based on if you draw CThun  Or  play all spells and hope random spells win the game for you  Dumb gameplay  and not exciting to play or watch\", \"commentId\": \"22545\", \"commentDate\": \"1468006079\"}, {\"comment\": \"Agree 100  Big dumb gimmicky cards
