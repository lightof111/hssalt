\"Officially joining the chorus of fuck rogues  I was wary as soon as I saw that even Team 5 saw the Quest as a way to encourage low cost charge minions and one turn kill combos    Two things theyve expressly said in the past they hate and acknowledge other people dont enjoy  I totally get that it takes more skill to trigger the Quest Reward by turn 5 than the usual aggro decks  but its still incredibly easy to simply bounce the same 1 cost minion around by turn 4  and then boom  turn 5 you press the I win game now button  It feels like the worst parts of every terrible deck weve had to deal with for the last year or so  in one go  Low cost  high attack minions  with charge  and the potential to end the game within 6 or 7 turns pretty consistently  while managing to negate the benefits that taunt and control based decks are meant to have over them  Cool stuff  next two years are gonna be fun\", \"commentId\": \"34792\", \"commentDate\": \"1491580807\"}, {\"comment\": \"new

this  Opened 30 packs without getting a SINGLE legendary  On the other hand  all I face is RogueWarrior quests who fuck me senseless  The legendary drop rate is a joke and should be equal for everyone  How is it fair that some people get 110 and others get 140  I understand there should be some kind of luck involved but this is ridonculous  Same with the last expansion  my roommates draw Aya and Patches from their free packs and draw 2 solid other legendaries within the first 20 packs  Me I get a fucking Don HanCho after 40 packs  Packwise  I am free to play  so maybe Blizzard is fucking me over because I dont pay for packs  I do however pay for bALLb the adventures and 10 games of Arena a month  Fuck you blizzard  Guess I should be spending my gold on AdventuresArena and my money on pack  Then I will finally get legendaries  Its unable to compete in the current meta without those quests  Oh and fuck you for releasing it to Europe at 3 in the morning  K thanks bye\",

this incredibly accurate sample of one unrefined game I wasnt too impressed   Im also underwhelmed by the hunter quest  Beat one easily with a budget midrange jadeelemental shaman no legendaries  only epics are Blazecallers and said Sjows Questing Warrior  I DID  however  get my face bashed in by a Hunters Bittertide Hydra  that did impress me There is hope for hunter after all  The salt is that I dont care anymore  I feel like a robot playing Hearthstone  No joy  I just opened packs that I did not spent any money on  learnt that the hard way with Gadgetzan not even looking and got two legendaries Warrior Quest and Spiritsinger Umbra  was like meh  couldnt be bothered with the raresepics  just goofed off a little  cleared daily quest slot  went off and played The Elder Scrolls Legends and found that way more enjoyable  I also did Arena  was kinda entertained when a pirate got eaten by my Golakka Crawler  but I didnt enjoy my Arena run all that much  It didnt help that I was at 12 and then  when I was ahead in the early game  I DCd and lost \", \"commentId\": \"34800\", \"commentDate\": \"1491582674\"}]"
