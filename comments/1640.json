Im playing the brawl for fun to wind down since ladder is so shitty My opponent I was playing with decided to skip turns when they could have attacked and dealt hefty damage to the pinata  then after they did hit it and were given cards from it  they never used them  They also sent that minion that deals 4 damage if you have 4 other creatures on your side of the field DIRECTLY TO MY FACE  I kid you not  it was intentional because they first aimed it at the 57 and instead hovered over my face for a few moments and then dealt the damage  At first I assumed it was a mistake  then I realized they were probably wasting my time after a couple of sketchy plays so you know what I did  I conceded on them  Not going to stick around and play a game with someone whos intentionally trying to make it not fun   Screw you jerks who think its fun to mess with other peoples enjoyment of the game  especially in tavern brawl\", \"commentId\": \"34436\", \"commentDate\": \"1490975678\"}, {\"comment\":
