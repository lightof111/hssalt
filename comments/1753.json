\"The problem is twofold 1 Secret eater is absolute garbage versus every other class   At most  if I put 1 in my deck  Im not guaranteed to have the card when I need it  so its such a niche tech choice that ruins my matchups against other classes   At least Kezan Mystic had a usable statline and taking the secret is actually gamechanging  2 Its not just Ice Block on its own   This isnt like Murloc Paladin where a single Hungry Crab can instantly swing the game in your favor   There is so much randomly generated garbage that you can never prepare for against a Mage   I remember one game where a mage got Bloodboom from Kabal Courier  which let him use Firelands Portal on my Ancient Watcher on Turn 3  and got a 56 body   What is that  Its so triggering when youre preparing for Hunter  Paladin  Druid properly   and then all shit goes to hell against Mages   No fun whatsoever\", \"commentId\": \"36772\", \"commentDate\": \"1494131967\"}, {\"comment\": \"how the fuck do you beat quest
