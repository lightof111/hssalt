a Wild Pyromancer comes out  Then when I use resurrect  instead of the 47 or sylvannas or something good  the wild always comeback and the game is ruined  Every deck with hard RNG its not the deck Im used to play  But  if it is my enemy who is playing this deck  oh god\", \"commentId\": \"25140\", \"commentDate\": \"1472675240\"}, {\"comment\": \"Oh it feels soooo good to rope hunters in high ranks who are trying to get legend last day of season  Sadly its the only thing I enjoyed today about Hearthstone  Im happy to play against face Shamans  Im happy to play against yogg Druids  Im happy to play against any cancer deck you can possibly imagine  I seriously dont mind them  But if you play Hunter in standard  here is my big sincere fuck you to all of you  Do me a favor and switch back to Shamans and Zoolocks like you used to play  Your brain cannot process more complex decks anyway\", \"commentId\": \"25141\", \"commentDate\": \"1472676530\"}, {\"comment\": \"Sadly I virtually never ever liked Hunter until the cloaked huntress shit made me a little curious  but mostly I got sick of the aggro meta even pervading casual play so much that it becomes too competitive for fun decks to be nice to play half the time unless you get some really disgusting RNG in your favor  I resisted zoolock and face shaman after coming up with a fun Wild zoolock deck initially well not original it would certainly always turn out  I dont like the limited margin to become proficient at the more complex and challenging decks  Ultimately that is where the fun is for me as I dont really care about ladder  but at some point getting faced becomes a bore so it becomes tempting to start being part of the cancer  For a few rounds only that is  cause it is not actually interesting  I dont remember the meta being this bad     was okay before WOTOG sort of Im probably due a remotely useful legendary or two after tens and tens of packs and getting Nat and the other Nat     Yeah i appreciate the dust and yeah i can craft myself  but some of these legendaries I would never spend dust on but would still be cool to play around with  And no I know legendaries dont make a deck good  apart from a few important staple cards    but still some of them can be interesting to focus a deck around  Anyway onik isnt that huge a game changer but hey after it is complete there is bound to be some funny deck crafting in there if only for shits and giggles  Try to optimalize the medivh and what not\", \"commentId\": \"25142\", \"commentDate\": \"1472677420\"}, {\"comment\": \"All my

rank you see this sort of shit and a while back you would rather start seeing it at particular ranks  rank ranges  To me  it seemed less pervasive  I guess over time I see the difference better between my own goodbad play vs  specific imbalanced stuff ruining things  Or instead thepredictability of easytoplay aggro decks rather relying on their draws and drops rather than having to make macro decisions to prepare wild combos that are incredible when pulled off  While Arena also relies a great deal on curving out and having the luck of getting spells  clears  AoE  I appreciate it right now because it demands flexible and creative play that challenges to find a way to turn the tide even with odds against you  I play plenty and do a lot of research  but ladder often i either boring onesided or puzzling to me\", \"commentId\": \"25145\", \"commentDate\": \"1472679618\"}, {\"comment\": \"Tinfoil alert Whoever wanted a proof that blizzard manipulates rng  play this tavern
