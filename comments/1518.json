cthunjade druid that I put together because I have both win as druid and play druid card quests   My opponent was a hand buff paladin  he had me down to 13 health had played all his buff cards  i managed to clear his board and stabilize then he plays a 13 attack Leroy from the far left of his hand gives me a well met and hits my face  I couldnt care less about losing to RNG or that theres too much of this class or that class or that whatever card is broken  if you dont like these things there are a million other games you can play   What gets to me is that when Im playing a game and it is dragging on only to be hit with lethal that my opponent had in his hand for multiple turns  just because he thinks hes funny or is a douche   I have things to do but thanks for allowing me to only get in one game in the short amount of time I have to play  I hope you feel good about yourself\", \"commentId\": \"31873\", \"commentDate\": \"1486130180\"}, {\"comment\": \"For the people who say Wild

most frustrating thing about the Jade Mechanic is also that it never costs any tempo They dont even have to lose the board to set up their win condition  just chain jade topdecks and you win more and
