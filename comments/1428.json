lost due to it buffing the whole hand and thus snowballing  As a person who often plays arena average 57 wins  not great  but still good  Arena is something fun to play ocasionally  but making it an alternative to ranked is an awful idea if you dont have an at least consistent luck on draft and opponents  If not  arena is a lot more broken try to fight a constructed deck with just a bunch of random cards that somehow dont even fit a curve than ranked you see a lot more bullshit  but at least you can also unleash it  instead of having to fight tanks with nerf guns  And that coming from someone who actually likes to play arena some times in a while  But lets face it  its only more fair if you lack too many cards  Otherwise it just brings the broken element to an RNG factor drafts  If a mode depending entirely on a luck element is not broken  then\", \"commentId\": \"29944\", \"commentDate\": \"1482408414\"}, {\"comment\": \"Its incredible how retarded aggro shaman players can make it to top 200 legend  Do they care about overextending into AoE No  Do they make favorable trades when they make their winrate a lot higher No  Do they get punished for all these shit misplays No

including Armorsmith on my board  that effectively pushed me out of lethal range  I thought to myself   well  he used pretty much all of his burst  has no cards in hand and has just almost wiped his

nowadays struggle to find in ranked games  By playing arena you are playing virtually all the cards that you never played before and you never expect what your opponent might do in the next turn  not even mentioning that it is in wild format so you can make a new combination of the old cards and the new ones  Arena is certainly comparable to the ranked mode considering the whole purpose of playing this game is to have fun  In ranked  you do not need to have skilled or enjoy RNG moves  Every unskilled player can feel this fake sense of achievement by taking advantage of broken mechanisms in the ranked mode  whereas it is entirely different Arena  which is why I suggested going for it instead of getting salty and salty and eventually start playing pirate decks to make the others feel the

cases yes  I mulligan for it against shamans Lucky players easily yell coz your bad  when they would be the first ones breaking their screens in if they had to face the same shit  I win most of my

Also  just because Renolock is strong now  it doesnt mean its not skill intensive seems like a heavy misconception nowadays  considering you use it as an argument  Remember Patron or the old Miracle Rogue They were overpowered  but at least needed heavy decision makings  and bad players would still lose with it Now ANY deck can be weak against this brainless pirate face decks  unless they find exactly the answer the deck provides  so guess what  you are wrong on that one too  and I couldnt be happier if people find it annoying in case I happen to have the answer My point is  you can play bad and still get high legend by just pointing your mouse to the face  If this is the ideal gameplay you want from a game that is supposed to be at least partly competitive  then I can only feel pity
