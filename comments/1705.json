the amount of luck needed to pull it of  The problem i have with this is that you cant react or prevent it from happening  Triggering the quest is a no brainer  stalling the game and preventing it from beeing played is frustrating  and the fact it cant be stoped once the combo is ready is a designfault  There should not be an infinitive wall of fireballs  They remove ragnaros  sylvanas to open up designspace  but then they make crap like this    Sure  i manage to beat it once or twice  mostly if they have bad draws  my mad scientist eats a doomsayer or when the dirty rat manages to get antonidas once in a lifetime  But a playstyle  that pulls of a combo like this should simply not be in the game  I think the timewarp is a gamedesign mistake  You cant interract once it happens    Give ANY class 20 manacrystals in 1 turns and you get destroyed  Its bad design\", \"commentId\": \"35761\", \"commentDate\": \"1492772653\"}, {\"comment\": \"tavern brawl is broke   three straight
