\"1472735756\"}, {\"comment\": \"Lets take a look at your statements Execute is the most efficient removal in the entire game   Since Warrior has no damaging hero power  you need this and at least part of another card to remove something  Yes it is very strong  but i would argue hex the stronger removal since it is only 2 mana more  a stand alone card and even remove deathrattles  tirion e g  Brawl is the most efficient sweeper in the entire game  This is simply not true  It leaves a minion on the board  so it is not a sweeper at all  and Pyro  Equality is even better mana wise  Fiery Win Axe is the best early control in the entire game   ok i give you that one Gorehowl is tied with Doomhammer for the best weapon IN THE ENTIRE GAME   I honestly do not think so  Gorehowl requires constant usage of your life total  which is in the current very aggressive meta a liability  It is only really good in control mirrors  where your life total is not significant Tank Up is the best use of Justicar Trueheart in the entire game   Ever played against a paladin spawning two 11s every turn Brann  Shieldbearer x2 is the largest health regen in the entire game   Reno  Tree of life have even bigger potential  but since this is no armor  your point is still valid Your second paragraph just shows  that you dont know how to play against  brawl  When you play a deck with lots of big threats  just play one maximum two at a time  Yes a number of them will be removed by shield slam  execute  But he has only four of those  After this he just eats the damage of your big minions  The warrior was always weak in control mirrors  when the opponent knows how to play around certain things  since it doesnt know how to pressure  but simply tries to outlast you\", \"commentId\":

everyone  but on Rank 108 it seems like Im matched against a res priest about half the time  and of those matches I lose about 23 of the time no matter what I do   I think its kind of insane that any class has 6 removals and 4 board clears in their deck  2x shadow word pain  2x shadow word death  2x excavate  2x entomb  2x shadow word horor not to mention circle of healing with soulpriest and Any priest who gets a decent draw just removes any threat you play immediately  Its the most frustrating class to play against  When he removes all my minions and heals himself constantly  then resurrects any threat I remove    its a completely unbalanced and op deck     Aggrotempo cant beat him because he heals himself too fast and removes every threat  control cant beat him because he resurrects eveyr minion you remove  and midrange cant beat him because of both of those reasons  Even call of the smorc and autoincludenaros  the imineverydecklord cant beat him\", \"commentId\": \"25176\",
