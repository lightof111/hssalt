minions quest though so I figured Id hang on as long as possible and just try to clear board  Anyway  like I said  really really enjoyable game lots of really smart plays by both of us  I was planning on adding them afterward  but then on their lethal turn they started spamming The pleasure is mine  over and over and waited for the rope to start before they went through with their turn  So that sucks  At least they showed me that they were an immature asshole before I added them and actually had to read whatever idiocy they would likely spew\", \"commentId\": \"21585\", \"commentDate\":

Hearthstone career  just a stupid amount of bad breaks and draws losing to top deck after top deck after top deck  Last few games have been playing a Reno Mage  which whilst I know isnt top tier or anything is a lot of fun to play and decided to stop being serious and just have fun and see how it goes  Game 1 Hunter  Reno in the bottom 8 Cards Not Drawn  Loss Game 2 Warrior Reno in the bottom 2 Cards Not Drawn  Loss  Game 3 Hunter Reno in the bottom 11 Cards Not Drawn  Loss Game 4 Priest Reno last card Not Drawn  Loss Game 5 Rogue Reno in the bottom 16 cards Not Drawn  Loss Game 6 Warlock Reno in the bottom 12 cards Not Drawn  Loss   Literally got the the point where I thought I had forgotten to put him in the deck  went back double checked  removed him and readded him just to be sure    Game 7 Shaman Reno in the bottom 16 cards Not Drawn  Loss Game 8 Warrior Reno last card Not Drawn  Loss   Just to do the math on that  In 8 games Excluding Mulligans I drew  1418162911282229  167 out of the 240 Cards and didnt see any of those 8 Renos  The fact that it was the last card TWICE in 8 games  is just fucking outrageously bad luck  It wouldnt even have helped in the 8th game as Id still have died but still  What honest to fucking bullshit RNG is this   Also I got 3 FUCKING SHATTERS off a Cabalist tome in the last game  Honestly fuck this\", \"commentId\": \"21593\",

several aggro players 1  The ones that apparently dont play a card game to think turns through  but prefer just winning  These people somehow get satisfaction from undeserved wins in a virtual card game  2  The delusional ones These people either have talked themselves into believing these decks takes skill  or pretend the deck takes skill because its all they can play  The retarded ones also belong in this category Even aggro decks require alot of thought for these guys  so its nice Blizzard has taken the mentally disabled into account  3 The poor ones These people dont have the money to play a good slowpaced deck  so play aggro  This  however  does not explain how they can enjoy HS playing aggro  because Id honestly rather play no deck than only aggro  In order to belong to the poor ones you also have to belong to another category  because it lacks an explanation why you enjoy the game  4 The Jacksofalltrades These people play every deck there is  I sort of belong in this category with the exception of aggro  To belong to this group you have to either have a good reason to play every deck such as you want to learn how decks work  or belong to another category  5 The poor victims   The people that say If you cant cure cancer  get cancer a poor excuse in my opinion  Controlslow decks are still viable in my opinion  aggro is just the easy way out  6 The busy ones The people that only have a tiny bit of time everyday  It is very unlikely that you dont have half an hour tops to play a game of HS every day  but I can understand wanting to play several gamesdo your quests  These people often belong in category 7 aswell  These people are often rank 15 not that that is a bad thing  7 The casual ones The people that dont feel like thinking too much  and just want a simple  straightforward game to do something  Like those games that require you to tap on stuff to get coins that you can buy more stuff with  These people are often rank 15 not that that is a bad thing and often belong in category 6 aswell  because they are already so busy they dont want to do more thinking\", \"commentId\": \"21596\", \"commentDate\": \"1465984174\"}, {\"comment\": \"I actually came here to read some peoples opinions thinking they would be similar to mine but after reading page 1040 i literarly got fking braindamage  half of the page is filled with pathetic idiots trying to preach how fucking aggro shaman isnt op and is easy to beat and fun  hard to play  Like I get it if people dont have the cards to play slower decks or just have braindamage but if u  after playing this shit  come to the salt forum where everyone rages about your stupid little shit deck and then try to preach how hard and fun it is  then im sorry but i just have to tell you go back to your cave and play that op shit but dont pretend like its not op and its your skill that makes you succed with it  Im sure that people could train a fucking dog to grab the green glowing cards and either drag them onto the battlefield or to the enemy hero if u just make sure that all the enemy minions are hidden behind tape  That would explain why those idiots surrender if theres a taunt minion because i guess the think the game is bugged  End of rage and fuck u shamans who think theyre smart and that only the chosen shamans can get to legend with aggro shaman\", \"commentId\": \"21597\",
