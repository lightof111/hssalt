with loads of spells and majordomo as only minion  Repeat the match until he plays Mindgames soon  you can kill the majordomo and then beat the rag    and thats it  Best is priest  because of the lots of control spells  although then you might not want to put Entomb\", \"commentId\": \"24962\", \"commentDate\": \"1472410715\"}, {\"comment\": \"thats because they mulligan into them \",

play this shit Aggro fucks get perfect draw and you cant do shit  they dont yoou win   why pllay Well fucking played benny boy  great fucking pointless slot machine substitute for a game  benny boy can go fuck himself with 10 different random sized dildoes  I have had  fucking enough of this shit\", \"commentId\": \"24977\", \"commentDate\": \"1472422927\"}, {\"comment\": \"OK Im going to try and go into the group therapy phase of this thread  I know it is a place to bitch and some people dont necessarily want feedback   First of all I sympathize with you and I love this thread specifically because the game pisses me off and much as I love the game  I also agree that luck is more of a factor in this game than can be enjoyable if you arent expecting it or playing around it  good luck playing around yogg  Nothing pisses me off more than being 1 win away from rank 5 and losing to some random ass bullshit  However  because I keep stats with Trackobot it is easy to see that my win rate is positive and I just need to stay on track     One idea to make the game more fun is to make your own decks or try to find something more off meta than everyone else that is still good  I play my own dragon paladin  tempo rogue and control shaman decks and they each have advantages against certain meta decks I play anyfin paladin  patron warrior  and malygos rogue as well   I also tend to adjust my decks a lot if a specific deck is pissing me off  Either way feel free to add me on bnet manhack1706  I dont mind spectating and commiserating when people get fucked over by RNG\",
