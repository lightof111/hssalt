\"Please hearthstone  I can only take so much  Playing arena  First game playing against warlock  Double councilman into cult master to perfectly trade  Then into abusive to trade his cult master into my spectral knight  I finally stabilise the board and nope  Gets demon wrathed  Luckily  the rest of his turn was weak  I stabilised again and set the board for lethal next turn with kraken and etheral conjurer  Nope  bog creaper and annoyo tron  Next turn  my etheral conjurer is only left and I set him down to 6 hp and he only has an imp gang boss on the board  Nope  bane of doom into Malganis  Then  I top deck fireball next turn so sad    Next game  fucking cancer again  3 minions on board  Demolisher completely misses and that was 1 step to costing me the game  Same turn  I trade into one of his minions with my demolishes and there is a Muklas champion on the board and a buffed silverhand recruit  Plays bomb lobber  Nope  hits the silverhand recruit  Then  he proceeds to play stand against darkness and gets a whole board of fucking 22s  It doesnt stop there  He trades in his muklas champion and does a few trades  Plays a light in the darkness gets fucking Muklas champion again for a fucking full board of 33  Fucking arena  What a joke  Last game was at 2 wins 1 lose  This game was at 22\", \"commentId\": \"21789\", \"commentDate\": \"1466407198\"}, {\"comment\":

Northshire Cleric  he Rockbites her  Greetings  friend  Turn 2 play Loot Hoarder  he Flame Jugglers it  Incredible  We keep some turns playing while he keeps emoting his Incredible Guess what happened I turned the board and suddenly he was as silent as a grave  He went all face  lost board and cards  and I healed myself out of range  Just as punishment  I Woaaahd him and end the match  Typical I play shaman becaue I feel so mart with it and cant win with anything else baby  On the other hand  how is it  that every druid I play against has turn 2 Wild Growth into Mire Keeper into a perfect

what they do  I love all the crazy combos and amazing plays  I even love the little adorable voice lines that they have But some days all that goes out the window  Some days  I need to complete my quests  And sometimes those quests require me to win  And sometimes I just need that one last win to stop having to win and just keep playing the game at my own pace  And bloody hell do I hate those days Winning becomes all I think about  Winning becomes all I care about  If I dont win a game  my entire perception of that game gets skewed  as though nothing I did that game was clever  Nothing I did that game mattered  cause the quest still isnt done  I love the game to bits  I love playing the game to bits  But damn are win quests irritating  I couldnt bloody care less if I lose a game where the opponent pulls out a crazy win at the end  In most other games Im actually even happy to see that  its variety  its chaos  and its a laugh  But when Im at 45 wins as warlock  you wont see me smile when the 6th opponent in a row pulls some nonsense and I just barely lose because of it  Hopefully one day this wont affect me so much  Im getting better at letting this sort of thing go  But sometimes it just really hurts  Those win quests bring out a side of me that Ive never liked Wow this thread actually works  Coolbeans\", \"commentId\": \"21798\", \"commentDate\": \"1466428041\"},

enjoy it nearly 60 of the time my winrate Gaming is all about relaxation after a long  hard day  Hearthstone  is not that game  Because  there is too much cancer  RNG  bad draws which one way or another will bother you or add blood pressure So  if you are not enjoying the game when you lose  just quit it\", \"commentId\": \"21799\", \"commentDate\": \"1466428880\"}]"
