exactly what it is  things are always up and down with the game  and thats normal  as the game should be always changing  but this is the worst Ive felt about Hearthstone at any one given time  The game feels stale  I dont feel excited about trying to get higher on the ladder  it seems like in general the people playing are saltier than ever  and I am not even having fun game to game  Each game honestly feels like a crapshoot  regardless of the cards or skill I know    of the player  I cannot stand playing it right now  I hope Blizzard can make it fun again  or maybe I just need a break for a while\", \"commentId\": \"30890\", \"commentDate\": \"1484187236\"}, {\"comment\": \"Its just a game that offers no progression as you keep playing You start  its fun  you get quests  level up heroes  acquire cards  But then extremely fast you just run up on ladder against the same 3 netdecks and theres really nothing whatsoever to do or gain by playing more So all you have left is playing the game  which you quickly realize is just kind of shit  Its too fast  too random  too volatile  but now youre already invested in the game  You have built your account  You have daily quests to check  but no actual longterm goal to accomplish You just play waiting for the day where maybe the devs stop sucking\", \"commentId\": \"30891\", \"commentDate\": \"1484188556\"}, {\"comment\": \"I

midrange paladin midrange patron warrior and NZoth rogue  and of course OP midrange shaman  all of them survived Renos appearing  Midrange is pretty much dead because Gadgetzan cards have been either hard aggro or hard control  Kazakus adds a really big punch and can nullify both big boards and big minions  Jade Idol is incredibly harmful to midrange because they are not as fast as aggro  and thus they have much mroe possibilities of being overrun by endless jade golems  and midrange often suffers a lot from hard aggros  wich are in a pretty good shape right now thanks to disgusting 1 mana 32 gnome that summons Stonetusk Pirate  Midrange always thrives in metas where face decks are not too mighty  because hard aggros are their main weaknesses  And with aggro in such a strong situation  and control mighty enough to not give midranges a big enough winrate to balance means once again is pirates and jade idols fault for polarizing the meta\", \"commentId\": \"30901\", \"commentDate\":
