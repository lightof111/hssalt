thankful it aint shamans are Yogg Druid x2 and Yogg Warrior and while losing to that while goofing around in casual wouldnt hurt me much  it hit me hard in ranked I have a problem with Yogg and all of you Yogglovers can argue here with me as long as you want because it requires no or small board building and comboing  Get the removals and throw Yogg ASAP So is it fair to have card which can turn
