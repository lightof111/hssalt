ranking up  All my opponents have either been Pirate Warriors  or Dragon Priests who use so many operatives that the games just not fun  I either dont get any time to set up and do anything  or by the time I finally do develop a board the Pirate Warrior has me close to death if not lethal on the following turn  or the Dragon Priest has stolen so many of my cards AOE  Hard Removal or Large Threats that theres no possible way for me to win  Just last night I made it to rank 13 after a ridiculous grind  only to play again today and fall back into rank 14 again with a hard loosing streak  Ive been trying to play unique decks that are a little more fun but the winlose rate to whats in the meta right now is awful  Probably going to change to Wild again and play there and even then I still had the issue of my fun being wrecked by PWs and DPs  Ive seen my fair share of Reno as well especially when he gets bounced and they basically have infinite life but I think I much prefer playing against a Reno deck than I do PW or DP  At least then I get a sense of omg Im actually playing the game and not getting smORKed to death before I can do anything \", \"commentId\": \"33766\", \"commentDate\":

because they can do nothing about the stealthd minions  well what the hell can I do about the fifth Arcanite Reaper of the day hitting me in the face We put in all these early game cards but none of

have changed my opinion of your postings a lot you are aokay in my book  Now back to the salt  Would it be very hard for the devs to implement a strict separation between standard and wild Shouldnt be  as they are different decks alreadythey should just deny wild format to standard decks oh and if they want to go the extra mile  qualify a wild deck without any wild cards as standard by a forced builtin check  I come to wild for a different experience  not to face the friggin exact same jade druids as on standard  Dont get me wrong  I run a jade druid myself  I dont hate the deckon standard
