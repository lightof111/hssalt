that you love making Aggro concede but thats painful to play against with any slower Deck     You know youll be up for card stealing for like 30 minutes and then end up losing the fatigue war cause

every player seems to go out of hisher way to make their opponent feel miserable  I notice the same in all those funny Hearthstone videos on Youtube  I know theres something as sore losers  but the concept of sore winners is something new to me  And if youre really lucky  you also get a friend request by said winner so they can gloat a bit more  Back to squelch again\", \"commentId\": \"38521\",
