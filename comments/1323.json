{\"comment\": \"I had drafted this gorgeous Arena Deck good curve removal and Deathwing on top of all that     Ofc it was too good to be true     First 2 games were fine Lost the 3rd one but it was pretty close  and it probably was cause of a stupid misplay I made    4th game I get a Shaman that plays turn 1 Spirit Claws and obviously proceeds to roll the Spelldamage totem to kill my 3 drop a couple of turns later  but I still have a good curve and a lot of removal so its fine     He then topdecks 4 mana 77 which I cant kill cause my removal seems to be on strike plays something on turn 5 a Piloted Sky Golem on 6 and Kvaldir Raider plus stupid damn Healing Totem that prevented me from pinging the minions Ive been hero powering for ages on turn 7     So yeah fuck you Totemic Call     Oh and if having to deal with Shaman bs in Arena as well wasnt enough my stupid internet connection decided it was a good idea to disconnect and sabotage my last game     The only positive thing is that at least I got rid of that annoying 5 spare gold that was the main reason I had bought the run\", \"commentId\": \"27747\", \"commentDate\": \"1478738920\"}, {\"comment\": \"Whats up with all these

unwritten community rules like rolling rules  etc   Ive never tried to cheat anyone out of anything in game and in real life    Yet in Hearthstone  I used a bot to get two golden heroes   I feel nothing   Whats the difference between me pulling the arm on the slot machine and a program I got the dumb shaman quest this morning for 30 shaman cards  of course get matched up against another shaman   Five totem rolls in a row  I get Searing   Meanwhile this moron  who I suspect was botting  had perfect curve and rolled every totem exactly what and when he needed it   Ridiculous that I can plan out my plays  play around threat  save removal for expected threats  etc     doesnt matter  cause luck bailed him out the entire time  It was disgusting  and its why I will never  EVER regret botting   The only skill this game requires is mastery of your own fucking rage\", \"commentId\": \"27759\", \"commentDate\": \"1478784397\"}, {\"comment\": \"TBH botting doesnt take away anything from other players  whereas  in your example  ninja looting in WoW does  If anything  considering how bots play  most players are better than them  so youre actually mostly giving wins to people  Its just a matter of you thinking golden heroes are an achievement or just getting a neat portrait\", \"commentId\": \"27760\", \"commentDate\": \"1478786170\"}, {\"comment\": \"cant wait to fuck every
