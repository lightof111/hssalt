sleeping Tyrande is a fucking priestess just read it  is the High Priestess of Elune  Elune might be the very first being of light ever created  in fact  Tyrande is more holy priestlike than Velen itself he and the rest of draenei worship Naaru  beings of light created by Elune  But unlike the godess  they turn into void beings when they die  Humans are primitive in comparison  they worship the Light  wich they dont truly understand  but the real priests  the priests of priests  were always draenei and night elves and thus  the ones of the real religion  Yes  she also has hunter things  and what If Voljin made it to priest  she can  She is a lot more priest than a voodoo guy  And well  dont get started on games logic  because since when is a paladin an utter douchebag who uses murlocs and shields himself behind poor 11 guys he freely sends to death Since when are shamans unable to choose their totems Since when is the almighty Illidan Stormrage destroyed by a Magma Rager\",

are brainless to play  How is control warrior any better Its just as easy and brain dead to play  Just armour up with shield bash  hero power and bash  Use shield slam for removal  use ghoul then 1 mana hard removal  Play justishit true fuck for more armour gain  Next turn play brawl and clear board  Maybe the opponent still miraculously manages to gain the board back No problems play more removal like gore howl  another shield slam or execute or a second  brawl  Then star seeker more armour another brawl to clear board again then iron forge portal  Even if your opponent somehow manages to survive this onslaught of seeminling infinte  removal and armour gain then just drop yogg on the board and of course it will be exactly the right spells you need  Fucking impossible to beat this shit unless you play a fatigue deck and even then  Something needs to be done about all the cheap removal and armor gain for fuck sake  Last warrior I faced gained 60 points of armour and I played perfectly and still survived until yogg got dropped and the cunt has the cheek to taunt me like he made some amazing thoughtful play  Retards thinking they are good hearthstone players because they play yogg  Get rid of him NOW  Im so salty you could shake me over your meal and season your French fries\", \"commentId\": \"26126\", \"commentDate\": \"1474326057\"}, {\"comment\": \"Playing against control warrior with my reno mage  He is rank 1  and as expected  a true retard  Wastes double execute and double shield slam on my first 4 weaker minions  Plays weak brawls  and overdrawing heavily  so my plan is to fatigue him  20 minutes later after several hard clearing turns solved my last card was Elise a seen later  he got it way earlier  he plays his monkey  already in fatigue  I have 4 cards left in deck  full hand  and ice block up  sitting on a reno and multiple removals  He had 5 cards left in hand  He plays Yogg he got from the monkey  I just knew it could fuck me somehow  but I had block  what could go wrong He filled his board among several perfect spells  and managed to casted naturalize on 2 of his minions  I draw 4 cards  he drew NONE  Next turn I die from the first fatigue damage  Fuck this godfucking game  25 mins of outplaying your opponent  and blizzard no  not the game  RNG is rigged rewards the retards with perfect rng  Its like you go to work  but at the end of the month your salary is given to people who did nothing the entire month    Next game I also lost to yogg to a druid who coin innervated Fendral on turn one  and hero powered turn 2  When I had heavy board control  he played this cancer  filled his board  cleared mine except 1 highattack minion  casted a paladin secret  The yogg gave him so much vaue that my only out was hitting his face and topdecking some burst next turn  Of course its eye for an eye  and I die to him the next turn  Really blizzard  fuck you  I wish the same luck happened to all of you card designers in real life
