need to actually have those overloaded crystals be currently locking the mana of the present turn   so that you were forced to 1  Overload a LOT on that turn  meaning its very obvious youre gonna do that  which can just open for Doomsayer  and that your opponent basically gets a turn where theyre free to do whatever they want since your Jade Golems dont have Charge and youre unlikely to remove anything 2  Have high Overload to be able to play that card  8 overload gets you a full board  but 7 gets you 3 golems  6 gets you 2 golems  and 5 only one  And  again  Im not saying 8 is the right number  I simply dont play shaman to be able to know   But yeah  should probably have put a higher cost for a bigger Overload requirement  especially because of 2 mana unlocks\", \"commentId\":

with spells until you can get brann out  then drop yogg on the next turn and get the most ridiculous possible result  The most I got was I think 48 spells  because Yogg killed me   The madness begins
