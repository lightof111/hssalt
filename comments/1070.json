otherwise its lethal  Guess when did those shitbags decided to Auchenai\", \"commentId\": \"22338\", \"commentDate\": \"1467587156\"}, {\"comment\": \"So  youre just as bad   Obviously  I didnt mean it literally  A more correct statement would be completely retarded at Hearthstone    I did address the subject  but I had no strong need back up my claim until previously  Its not as if you backed up your claim either    1  Unit positioning  Every unit  excluding the first  requires thought about their placement  This is something unique to zoo and shaman  Though  the difference between shaman and zoo is that zoo doesnt really have a general rule to follow if you want perfect positioning  You would have to rethink about every unit placement every time  In addition  zoo generates massive boards and plays an abundance of minions  Once your board gets large  you would have to make 20 calculations just for units placements every turn  Though  the core behind unit placement is thinking ahead  To properly place your units  you have to think multiple turns ahead taking into account the minions you and your opponent will play  Thus  it requires an extensive knowledge behind the game  To perfectly position your units for direwolf alpha and defender is a difficult thing  and yes  it is important  One poorly placed unit will fuck up your board  2  The discard mechanic Discarding is something unique to zoo  It requires you to take into consideration risk  reward and necessity  This adds difficulty to the card attached with the discard mechanic  You also have to evaluate the value of the cards you are discarding think ahead about whether you should dump your hand or save them weigh the risk of drawing into another discard card  If you think about it  soul fire is just a form of removal  Consider shield slam and add the discard mechanic to it  it would obviously make shield slam a more difficult card to play skillwise  Soulfire also serves as a multipurpose tool removal or a finisher  which also requires you think about which it should be used for  3  Zoo is a control  aggro and combo deck Zoo will fluctuate between these play styles depending on the match up and state of the game  This means the player has to have an understanding of all of these play styles and know when to switch between them  Zoo also shares the same difficulties as each of these types of decks do with some minor differences of course  The really only big difference with zoo and other standard control decks is zoo does not run much removal  However  zoo is more susceptible to removal than most other decks and thus  more thought goes into playing around cards  To play aoe and to play around aoe is almost synonymous  To play around  you must simulate the thought behind the person playing the aoe and thus  playing around aoe is more difficult  4  Abundance of decisions Compare the decisions zoo has to make compared to the control warrior  The control warrior has on average 12 valid plays to decide from each turn  which really isnt that difficult  The control player is mostly told what to do based on their mana  Turn 2 play axe if available or armor up  Turn 3play axe or bash if available or otherwise armor up and ect  For the control player  there is generally 1 card that will just take up their entire turn  but the options for zoo are split up into many tiny components  The zoo player will have to filter through these options and determine the best  The reason zoo is more difficult is because there are more options  and they arent always clear cut  Zoo will have many options with very similar strengths  Zoo is similar to miracle rogue in the sense that it has a lot of options with similar outcomes  and miracle rogue was deemed a difficult deck  was it not   5  Life is a resource and the hero power Just like a control deck  zoo players also have to manage their life because it directly corresponds with the ability to tap  Like I mentioned previously  zoo shares many features of a control deck  Since tapping is such a powerful ability  it adds an extra decision to be made  This is unique to warlock  To tap or not to tap  Its important to have a thorough understanding behind because as a zoo you will tap a lot  Tapping draws you a card  That means the usual thought process when drawing cards also applies thinking about the cards you are looking for calculating the odds you will find the card and weighing it determining how necessary finding that card is  In the later stage of the game  tapping will become obvious when its your only play  Though  you would have to take life and necessity into account and play around the usual cards   There are things I might have missed but this summarises my main thoughts  I agree zoo is a forgiving deck but in high level play  the player is assumed to be playing perfectly  so its forgiving nature is almost meaningless\", \"commentId\": \"22339\", \"commentDate\": \"1467595592\"},
