you cant adjust to people wanting to play short 510 minute games on average  you might want to look into something else   And honestly if the whole meta was pure aggro  good control players would feast   Not to mention the fact that a competitive Cthun deck would actually require some fairly expensive control cards to be viable   Slapping down Cthun buffs on curve with Frostwolf Warlords is not the recipe for a cheap viable deck  The meta is very balanced between playstyles  which makes it frustrating to try to win consistently   But  for once  you can actually play control  midrange  aggro and combo credibly in the same meta\", \"commentId\": \"21300\", \"commentDate\": \"1465332209\"}, {\"comment\": \"Playin with control against aggro all day long with no single freeze mage
