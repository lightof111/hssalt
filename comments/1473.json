me  for some reason  every minion the opponent puts on the board has Taunt  That might also be the reason why Ive only reached rank 5 twice despite playing this game since GvG came out That and the fact that I also like playing arena  And yes  for a while  I rode the aggro is cancer train too  But I took off  accepting the fact that aggro should be a part of the meta  Otherwise  Jade Druid would be the cancer that everyone hates for example  Or some greedy ass combo deck like the KunThun Druid  who knows  Hell  to some people  Reno is the cancer  You know  the card that stands as the cornerstone of a lot of control decks right now  And the funny part is  for a year and a half  Reno Jackson was just some cute Tier 3k card that people didnt care about  You know  the same thing Pirate Warrior was before MSG came out  So why is it that people start calling cancer to every deck that goes popular  God  I went off topic there for a while  sorry about that  The thing is  if you feel the need to play something else WHILE playing Hearthstone  like it was suggested a few posts ago just so you can pass your time while roping  why dont you just play that game Why do you feel the need to waste your time and some other persons time Hell  since aggro is so brainless a bot could play it  dont you think you might be wasting a computers time And last time I checked  computers dont care if you waste their time  In all seriousness  if you feel so disgusted by a part of the game  and a part of the game you claim is everywhere  maybe you really should stop playing that game and do something instead  Hell  check out a couple of Bob Ross streams instead of playing the game  It sure helps me when Im feeling down\", \"commentId\": \"30912\", \"commentDate\": \"1484245440\"},
