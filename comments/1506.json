in that  Story is  I decided to jump on hearthstone today to try out this deck my buddy gave me  Granted its a meta deck and is certainly not bad  I dont believe Im a very bad player either  I havent reached legendary yet but Ive come close  Im a fairly avid player used to be this meta can suck my ass when it comes to ladder  But anyways  I started up and faced 2 shamans  then 2 pirate warriors  then another shaman  All of them had the same decks with each other  none of them were the same players either and ultimately I went 05 WL and then exited the game immediately  Now Im here ranting on how fucking much I hate hearthstone now  Believe me  I want to like it but ITS SO HARD TO   The only thing left I have to enjoy is arena     Blizzard has truly fucking ruined Hearthstone  its pushed me to the point where I will completely stay away from the cancerous ladder now  I wish Blizzard would see this and just make it so at least half of the classes can enjoy the meta for each expansion But no  only 13 classes actually get to enjoy each expansion because its fair that classes need intervaled buffs  Give me a fucking break already  I just want to climb ladder for my golden rogue but i cant win games anymore       i will never stoop to playing shaman or warrior now because it just adds to the mega cancer avalanche blizz has got rolling for us   Good thing i wasted my time and money on this game  Im waiting for the next expansion now tyvm\", \"commentId\": \"31631\", \"commentDate\": \"1485677554\"}, {\"comment\": \"Mill Rogue  all the pirates had made me forget how much I
