"[{\"comment\": \"From my pov  its not players fault  and i hate aggro deck as much as the other 50 Its clearly Blizzard fault by this side  at least is what i think Poor judgement in releasing cardsmechanics  Poor mind setting in fixing stuff Shaman is the least played class Lets make em OP cards  AGES to fixnerf cards They just want money  Like any other company  But im pretty sure they have zero competence how to obtain balance in a game  I know this could sound pretty arrogant  but  playing from beta  its what ive learned by experience And guess what Every adventure they release  every expansion they release   were all here ready to give in cash If playerbase drop a lot in a short period of time   im pretty sure their ass became hot enough to wake themselves up  But it will never happen\", \"commentId\": \"29218\", \"commentDate\": \"1481262006\"}, {\"comment\": \"I think right now Blizzards judgement when theyre about to release a new expansion is something like this Oh  man  these cards that were about to release look awful  Lets just throw some OP earlygame cards so that players have to either play them or to counter them  And there we go  having our beautiful

aggro decks like Hunter or Warrior atm or OP Control Decks like Control Jade    but on the other hand you are the same stupid idiots  who preorder and buy 50 packs on top of that  How stupid are you If people would start to hoard their gold  no one would need be spend money on this game  okay  I can understand it  if you like to spend money on Adventures  thats okay  If Blizzard realises  that they are making less money  they might do something  but this way like everyone is preordering and buying 50 packs on top of that  nothing will change and thats not the aggro players fault  its yours The stupid brainless control player  who likes to have every card to test every possible Archetype and then you run to this thread to complain about aggro  Did someone shit in your brain or why dont

getting really really frustrating    This shouldnt even be designed to begin with  Idc about agrro decks thats cool but for a game to legit be over by turn 5 from just hitting face over and over is utterly stupid  end of rant\", \"commentId\": \"29229\", \"commentDate\": \"1481286935\"}, {\"comment\": \"The thing with netdecking is If you always used other peoples decks that promised you success  its hard for the most to go out of this habit for one simple reason   They never learned it  They dont know what makes a deck sucessful  They dont know what makes a deck consistant one of the most important factors  When people netdeck  they simply do not learn how to build a deck  They even have to ask what they have to replace cards with if they lack some of those  Im not here to blame those people  because some are simply not intrested in homebrew decks and thats ok  If you cannot or dont want to build your own deck  sure then dont  Im just here to explain this hole phenomen  The second thing is Decks from high legend players are usually decks that are refined to a point where you cannot make it much better  Everything else are tech cards and meta calls  Those stuff shifts constantly  So if you for instance want to build a Jade Druid deck and want to build one of your own you will quickly realize that the one you find on the net  is the one you have the most success with  because there is simply not a unicorn magical thing happening with a wombo combo no one has seen\", \"commentId\": \"29230\", \"commentDate\": \"1481287255\"}, {\"comment\": \"Pirate Warrior is frustrating
