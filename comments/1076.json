down a 77 55 taunt and more minions in the same turn  but thats not even why i lost  nooo because unlike his degenerate piece of shit of a brain i made calculated turns  but why should that matter  he will top deck blood lust anyways and win with 1 hp left droping me from 10 while having 2 taunts up  Id play against even secret paladin rather than this piece of shit and whoever designed the cards for this class in the last expansion can get a cactus shoved up his ass  And then i remember patron warrior is OP please nerf blizzard  Id take 50 patron warriors every day played by life coach rather than 1 thoughtless aggro shaman\", \"commentId\": \"22457\", \"commentDate\": \"1467844110\"}, {\"comment\": \"If you play Wololo Priest  you deserve anal with a cactus\", \"commentId\": \"22458\",
