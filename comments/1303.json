posted in another thread  when i switch to Freeze Mage  my first Matchup is always Warrior  I cannot remember in my last 2 years that this was different at one point  For myself i think there are some hidden calculators inside the program that filter your matchups  One shall not forget that blizzard registers every card ever played  as we can see in the recently puplished arena sheet  The jump from this to a controlled matchmaking system isnt so far fetched  it just difficult to find out by which rules it works  Certainly decks cannot be a factor  since you can come up with infinite possibilties\", \"commentId\": \"27329\", \"commentDate\": \"1477490243\"}, {\"comment\": \"Man I just cant stand BM  Im sure this gets thrown up here all the time  but come on people  Im obviously

factor  since you can come up with infinite possibilties  Its not about decks  Ofc there are limitless posibilities  Its about cards included in a deck  So eg  You put harrison or ooze  Youre gonna get queued with priests or warlocks who cant win any game because they are shit in this meta so lets just give them some points Your decks contains a lot of board clears Here is a control warrior for you  Its not liek algorithms have to know every single deck  Its just enough that they code it the way so certain cards will trigger the mechanic I know Java  HTML  c and more programming languages  Its not really that hard to do sth like that  Especially when you have a big budget and a good team\", \"commentId\": \"27348\", \"commentDate\": \"1477503115\"}]"
