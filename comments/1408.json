up both being in fatigue  I had the upper edge cause he mindlessly drew cards  I was 3 cards ahead  I play my elise and he entombs it  Monkey gives me a deathwing got some pretty good legendaries as well but deathwing was my win condition  When I deem necessary  I pop my deathwing and he is at 11 health with 3 cards in his hand  There was literally very few ways I could have lost this  yet I did  He gets a nexus champion saraad from the monkey and decides to try his luck    Guess what the random spell was    SHADOW FUCKIN WORD OF DEATH    Seriously What were the chances  Blizzard Things like

mostly  2 jade druids  Undertaker hunter  secret paladin  midrange shaman   each time we were thinking it cant be worse  but Blizzard managed to prove otherwise  The sad fact is this meta could have been actually decent  had they not printed for example Patches or Jade Idol  but they just had to fuck up again\", \"commentId\": \"29521\", \"commentDate\": \"1481716321\"}, {\"comment\": \"The only thing I hate a lot so far in this game is Brann Bronzebeards combo with Jade Spirit or Defender of Argus  Im so salty as much as I faced against aggro shaman  I personally hate that card alot and its more broken than any cards in this game and its the only win condition for jade golem users to pull this out from their asses  That also supports Dirty Rat where everyone hated that card  I believed its branns job to make dirty rat being op  because if you remember the combo that is really unrealistic  combine those two cards AND Mind Control Tech  I REALLY cant wait for this guy to get rotated the hell out of the standard format  all of these games I faced I could have won against it if there werent extra 77 jade golem on theboard  This card is too disgusting to play against it  because none of any cards are stronger than that brann bronzebeards shitty broken combo  probably even stronger than Dr  Boom even  And hear me out  hes more op than an actual deck whether its an ultraaggro deck or a heavycontrol deck  nothing can be worse than facing this guy  ever\", \"commentId\": \"29522\", \"commentDate\": \"1481716336\"}, {\"comment\": \"Its just fascinating how many pirate

fine  I had a cute little aggro deck with enough card draw for it to go well  as long as I play decently  and the deck actually pulled through  going 63  I mean  sure the last priest had a Velens Chosen topdeck that completely ruined me  which was kinda sad  but I had some fun  so it was nice  I wasnt too sad about it   But I guess Blizzard must have something like a salt measurement system connected to every account or something that triggers whenever people are having fun just to remind us how miserable life is  and boy  did it go off hard on me  I mean  why not just check my prizes\",

to put a couple of taunt dragons and  in the typical pussiness of the class  just buff health and heal and go empty way to face  cause the opponent aka me got the funny thing of having his top 5 most

stretch every game out as far as possible and get as absolutely few in the time they have before mommy puts them to bed When I was that age I was smart enough to realize my free time was at a premium
