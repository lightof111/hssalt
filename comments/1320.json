legend  now Im close to rank 3 again  just because the game decided to fuck me like every single day and give my opponents perfect RNG while I get nothing  Because getting the perfect curve and answer from 15 cards in hand just always fucking have to happen   My opponents havent missed a single mana for 12 games but Im just hero powering for 3 turns straight because thats fair and balanced  And the fucking shamans  how dont they miss a single fucking trogggolem opening Or hex within the first 7 cards every time for a bigger drop What is the fucking chance  I really need help  I can take losses
