people are going to realise how fucked this game is  NEVER GIVE BLIZZARD MONEY FOR HEARTHSTONE  YOU WILL REGRET IT   Who can recommend a decent  balanced card battle game Needs to run on a phone or

rather play a normal game against a deck like dragon priest  Just saying   I know  drakonid ooerayive does SUCK and I hate it too but thats the only bull shit card priest has  The rest are fine\",

belief and stupid  If you dont win within 5 turns you have deal with cards like 2 mana deal 2 summon a 55 or 4 mana 23 summon an 88 and dont get me started on Aya Blackpaw  Why would anyone play a tempo based rogue or questrogue Jade is simply better  Why would anyone play a rampdruid or combodruid Jade is simply better  For the Kabal variants at least there is a cost associated with their broken effects  The goons dont work well as standalones  But the jades are stupid  and incentivise cramming more of their cards in because they all become exponentially better if you add more  And it is the most frustrating feeling in the world to play against this kind of stuff  Your 10 mana card which pulled another 7 mana card got dealth with by 3 tokens from 24 mana cards  And the following tokens will be bigger than anything you put into your deck and built your deck around  Getting an outside perspective  it just hits you how stupid it is  Anyways  rant over\", \"commentId\":
