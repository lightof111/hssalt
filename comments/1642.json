wild with no wild substitutions while I was CLEARLY playing a divine shield quest  I mean I played all the worst minions one after another and actually got pretty close to winning  So the fact that you outplayed a guy running every conceivable divine shield minion with no spells and only the divine shield buff weapon at rank 20 wild doesnt actually mean youre any good  It just means that you lasted long enough so that I could play all 10 minions in one game and didnt have to waste my time with more people like you\", \"commentId\": \"34474\", \"commentDate\": \"1491031792\"},

weeks after I uninstalled Hearthstone  I have bought a Switch plus 2 games and I am 10 away of buying a Pro Controller plus other accessories  I have no problem paying for every expansions so as long the current state of the meta is better than the previous one  but sadly that is not case here  Honestly  I was looking forward to checking out all the released cards today  but unfortunately the magic feeling that Hearthstone gave me during early Beta period has faded away  Although  the new cards are significantly better versus MSOG so congratulations on this achievement\", \"commentId\":

and a mage and warlock both had one too  How come I NEVER draft legendaries I know legendaries arent necessarily better  but generally they are  It just bothers me when I lose to a priest at 7 wins  who played badly because he never had the guts to go face even when it was definitely the right play which seems to be a common problem among priests by the way and made some very awkward trades which overlaps with the face thingy  Well played You know  just because you traded your way through the entire thing and played minions on curve doesnt mean you played well\", \"commentId\": \"34481\",
