"[{\"comment\": \"I agree  Blizz needs some form of casual where quests cant be completed and gold isnt earned  Or if there were some way to make it so you only got gold if you were playing a unique deck  Perhaps they can have some sort of tracker that notes which decks have been played and only lets each deck be played a max of 20 times before it is banned from queuing up I know that would result in a lot of pirate warriors altering one or two cards so maybe once a set of 30 cards has been played  you can only have 25 in common with that list My idea seems convoluted so perhaps someone has a better idea\", \"commentId\": \"38024\", \"commentDate\": \"1495744885\"}, {\"comment\": \"annnnnnnnnnnnnnnd 20 damage in 5 turns because i couldnt deal with two 02 taunts and the 32 only goes

the more recent hall of fame move  I think the current tavern brawl might be a good way to implement a new casual mode  Just basicclassic cards and no epicslegendaries  That way its balanced for everyone  including new players who dont have a vast collection  CommonsRares are really cheap and youre always getting them from the classic packs from other brawls  This way  theres no epicslegendaries so people cant complain about F2P vs P2W  Theres no pirates aside from southsea deckhand  cold blood which is probably the only aggressive combo youll ever face  Murloc synergy isnt a thing anymore Warleaders arent there  no buffs  no new murloc cards  Mages turn into a basic Innkeeper provided deck that everyone starts out with and has played at the beginning of their hearthstone

more money from me   They need to make sure the meta decks arent so fucking ridiculously OP  They need to add an autosquelch feature  When they fuck up and let loose decks like Pirate warrior they need to nerf them faster and harder  How many decks feel they must include Golaka Crawlers JUST because of fucking patches and related cards  There is WAY to much randomness  try playing around mage
