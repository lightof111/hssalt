about hearthstone as I completely lost hope with its state and just had it with the constant aggro and other cancer decks that exploit what Blizzard thought were fun cards and damage bursts like projectile vomit  this is not the players fault who are following the games rules but the poor judgement and design of more than a few cards and mechanics since the games release by Blizzard lastly i would like to say that I did have fun playing and getting all 9 golden heroes with total wins of 6335 and 1423 in arena  having some insane moments and getting  a number of friend requests to  say that moment was amazing and gg and playing all the adventures in heroic and every single brawl expect heroic brawl because come on    so it was  not entirely a horrible experience but along the line the same mistakes were happening and the annoyance while and after playing is far greater than ever Farewell and happy feast of Winter Veil\", \"commentId\": \"29281\", \"commentDate\":

play a slow deck that doesnt have stupid burst because fucking jade decks will eat my deck alive  Caught between two  Retarded decks because blizzard cant just look at the card pools available and realize what idiots will come up with I hate jade as a mechanic  It is poorly designed  because it promotes a gameplay strategy and fantasy that leaves either player feeling cheated  The mechanic either is garbage because it gets rushed down  or disgusting because it auto crushes any slow deck  There is no tension  Either the jade deck gets to play a game of hearthstone or it doesnt  What a fucking great mechanic  Also  hoses control decks out of the game completely  All because  wouldnt it be cool  followed by hifives and beers as they all give themselves the day off  Jade is not a cool mechanic  It doesnt  create tension  between strategies  either your opponent is slow or fast and thats all that matters\", \"commentId\": \"29282\", \"commentDate\": \"1481352796\"}, {\"comment\":
