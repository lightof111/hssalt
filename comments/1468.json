\"1484036561\"}, {\"comment\": \"Actually its MUCH MUCH harder to play controlmidrange decks  Most of the time i make a mistake as aggro deck it doesnt amtter at the end as its usually not 1 dmg off lethal  And then always when playing control or midrange deck you have a feeling that every move you make take you close or further away from a victory achieved by avoiding aoes  trying to figure out opponents hand many many things which as an aggro player most of the time you dont even have time to play around  Whats more at the end of every midrange control game there is a lot to tihng about and learn from your mistakes  Ill never forget when after just 2 months of hearthstone i got to rank 9 with some spam face rogue deck and i thought wow thats so easy  And then when i finally got some dust for a midrange paladin deck it turned out that i couldnt have even passed by rank 15 or 14 dont remeber rly  But suddenly all the things started to matter  hitting face didnt make any sense  i still didnt know how to play around cards as i didnt need to i see the whole other aspect of this game\", \"commentId\": \"30809\", \"commentDate\": \"1484037187\"}, {\"comment\": \"To all aggro losers can

this card  And of course they always have the perfect counter in hand even with 20 cards in deck  Thats one of the thing that kind of frustrates me the most  When I play against a certain class they always have all the answers and curve in their hand  When I try decks like that I never ever have answers like that in my hand  resulting in a lot of losses  Sometimes I wonder what it must feel like

your opponent heals for 29 or they play 20 cards in one turn and get a 3 mana 2020  they can also just keep on playing 1 mana 3030s and shuffle some more of them into their deck they can also deal 20 damage in one turn  or they OTK you with 1 mana minions  If you look at it this way it might be a fairly balanced card  5 mana 56 draw a good card and take a look into your opponents deck   Either way the meta is not the best right now since it is all about who gets their broken combo first  Still better than the old midrange shaman \", \"commentId\": \"30815\", \"commentDate\": \"1484045478\"},
