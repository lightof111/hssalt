to correctly predict the secrets  Which often is impossible THEN you have to predict the spells created by Babbling Book and Cabalists Tome WHILE you keep a minion on the board for the Flamewaker Game won or lost by turn 5 solely based on the cards you draw    Vs  ShamanIf you get double area of effect AND Shadow Word Death  you win  If not  you lose    Vs  HandlockIf they draw Jaraxxus  you lose Vs  WarriorIf you dont have the second Entomb ready for CThun  you lose    Its just a long string of IF and THEN  and so many times  no strings lead to victory Theres so few choices  just forced reactions   You know whats coming  you know what you need  and theres only so many ways the game can go down based on what happens Winning feels hollow  because you know which card they didnt get\",
