ways you can win against them 1  they fail to mulligan for bounce cards 2  you play similarly retarded aggressive deck not cool 3  you add Fire Plumes Heart to your deck  then type taunt in search field and add every good taunt minion too  then add double Brawl and a Deathwing  as well as some general CW removal  which is kinda lame  plus  I dont have this quest lol 4  you have an insane luck

\"Just one page of the salt thread and theres five comments specifically about quest rogues  Maybe Blizz should read these threads and realize that they need to throw some nerfs out  Its absolutely insane that a deck this uninteractive and unbalanced should be able to exist  You cant exhaust them like you can with pirate warrior because of all the draw and token generation  You cant heal through the damage  You can try to burst them down first but they still have some removal that they can use  The only real way to stop them is through counter cards like Dirty Rat and Counterspell and even then  they can be played around\", \"commentId\": \"35656\", \"commentDate\": \"1492628538\"}, {\"comment\": \"Of course you pulled the lethal spell out of your ass at the last second  Goddamn
