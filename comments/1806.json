a fun deck that has been around for over three years now  and wed like to see more variety with Mage decks after each major release  This move allows Freeze Mage to continue existing in Wild  while creating more variety in Standard  Ice Lance also prevented us from making powerful Spell Damage cards and designs that allowed you to duplicate your cards  Ice Lance was also a very high burst damage card  sometimes being a key component of 30 damage combos   This is the reasoning behind Ice Lance rotation copy pasted from Blizzards article on the Year Of The Mammoth so yes it was rotated in a kinda failed attempt to kill Freeze Mage but also cause it enabled high burst damage combos so my point still stands XD     More than Inner Fire right now Im salty at Secret Mage    Mage was my first golden hero and its still the class I play the most but hell thats one of the most frustrating Decks to go against     The moment you know the secret is Counterspell but have nothing to bait it and then end up getting snowballed by a 1 drop    I hope its just the flavor of the month and we wont be stuck with that Deck in the meta for long\", \"commentId\": \"37867\", \"commentDate\":

UnGoro well since GvG even but UnGoro just killed it  Every Rogue you encounter is a QuestCancer  Only aggro decks like pirate warrior counter it  with all other decks you have almost no chance to win  The meta has never been shittier than now  They force cancerous archetypes on classes with their stupid quests   They removed archetypes like Combo druid in the past because it dealt like 14 dmg in one turn  It was too strong Bitch please  aggro decks now deal 13 dmg in the first 3 turns  QuestRoguetards can OTK with charging 55s  Balanced Blizz  really balanced applauds I had fun times with
