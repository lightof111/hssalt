luck plays a huge role in it but COME ON I havent been able to climb the ladder since I keep losing games to bad draw and bad rng for example yesterday I played taunt warrior mirror and I had 4 5050

warrior just to try and complete quest  its a really made up deck with no QUEST or legendary  yes  i was hoping for cheap win anyway  went against this really weird Mage deck  if it was going against

thought i was the only one going for cheap win  D\", \"commentId\": \"35028\", \"commentDate\": \"1491815036\"}, {\"comment\": \"Dont know why youd say they dont know how to play the deck because theyre roping every turn  Maybe  just maybe  its a difficult new deck to play so were actually using their brain and thinking ahead unlike most decks that are out there  Also theres this player called lifehelper or mindcoach or something that is known for taking his time and thinking and hes a bit good  Not every deck is an aggro or Curvestone deck that requires no more than 20 seconds of thinking every turn\", \"commentId\": \"35029\", \"commentDate\": \"1491815265\"}, {\"comment\": \"Allright  that evolve on his part was completely bonkers  I get the salt  However  you did make some off plays in my opinion  Used your Deathwing way too early for example  not to mention needlessly missing the Curious Glimmerroot discover  I dont know if youre interested in hearing my feedback  but I though since you left the game here anyway  might as well give it\", \"commentId\": \"35030\", \"commentDate\": \"1491815402\"}, {\"comment\": \"Im not understanding the salt towards the Quest Mage deck  By the time they finally have all their Combo pieces theyve cycled through their whole deck practically  Thats plenty of time to kill them its not like the issue with Jade Idol where not only can you never win by fatigue but they can get 1 mana 99s out by the mid game if they draw well enough  Quest Mage is slow as hel and actually takes some skill to play unlike Jade decks\", \"commentId\":
