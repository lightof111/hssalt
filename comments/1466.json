"[{\"comment\": \"Facing a golden shaman at rank 7  Alright  golden shaman  rank 7  youd expect some level of skill right Wrong  because thats not how shaman works  I pass T1  he plays SmallTime Buccaneer into Patches the Pirate   Alright  luckily I have my T2 Doomsayer  So what does he do on turn 2 Does he totem pass No he coins Lava Burst and kills the Doomsayer   If you think thats not a misplay  consider this He did not have a Spirit Claws  or a onedrop in his hands  so he had to pass his next turn  He ran double Thing from Below  so a totem pass wouldve been fine  Golden shamans

roping on purpose  2 Yes  It is absurd to assume that someone is a scumbag because of a deck choice  That doesnt make you a scumbag  Unnecessarily emoting  roping or other forms of BM make you a scumbag  Just to give you an example I added a guy and we dueled in order to test his Dragon Warrior against my Midrange Shaman back in the preMSOG meta  We played this matchup for more than 5 times and although I won almost all of the games  he said he doesnt feel the same anger towards shamans when hes playing against me  I assume thats mostly because I didnt emote or try to BM in any way   3

played a card that is overpowered  2 mana 26 taunt Choose a minion in your opponents hand and put it into play on their side  They wouldnt ever make that card  except they did because sometimes Dirty Rat is random  Whoops  the derp patrol strikes again Then he drops Alex on me  15 damage from an 88  unpreventable  Again  a card that shouldnt be in the game  Pyroblast costs 10 mana  Alex costs 9 and makes an 88  Good work idiots And now that Im at 15 and cant heal  I can die to hand burst  which is again impossible to interract with and deals far too much damage per card  Look at MTG  Dealing 6 damage to the face costs about 7 mana and 7 mana is about the equivalent of 10 for HS  Not only that  but it can be discard  prevented or countered But in hearthstone Nah just sit on your hand all

steam very quickly  so they need to do real damage in early game  I don t know which deck you were using  but i doubt you would be able to clear the board before those 2 drops did 5 damage  Even aggro decks need skill and thinking ahead\", \"commentId\": \"30766\", \"commentDate\": \"1483988153\"}, {\"comment\": \"No  it was definitely a misplay  First of all  he wasnt a face shaman  he was a more of a midrange jade shaman  Face shaman doesnt run double thing  manatide and rag  Second of all  if he had a weapon or one drop to follow it up  you could argue that it was the right move because  it gained him a lot of tempo  But it didnt  the next turn he had to go face with his 12 and 11 and pass  If he had used hero power he would have reduced the cost of his things by 2  and he wouldve kept both the coin and lava burst  He did have a flamewreathed in hand  so if he had totemed he couldve coined that out next turn  And I was playing renolock so it wasnt very hard to clear\",

look at yourself  Last of all  I dont mean that if you play pirate warrior you should die  but if you can bring yourself to do it in casual despite your conscience   I mean I cant save you there   I
