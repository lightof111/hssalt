 No fun involved  No skill involved  No originality involved  Is this whats Hearthstone becoming into Stale boring mechanics which require 0 braincells  Just throw some incredible low mana cost minions and spells to the opponents face  Hope they havent pulled an answer and BM to victory  What a fucking disgrace this game is  And to top it off  fucking BLOODY EXPENSIVE  50 euro for some stupid cards and most of them you dont even play\", \"commentId\": \"35210\", \"commentDate\": \"1492010863\"}, {\"comment\": \"OK This fuckin Exodia mage   be damned How is this deck even BALANCED Kappazard  Just played against a guy who pulled 4x Iceblock  4x Blizzard and out of 14 turns the game did last I had my creeps frozen in 7  How on Earth could ve you created such a deck   I m now conceding to any T1 Open the Skillgate mage I meet because it s just a fuckin waste of time  I mean seriously pissed am I  this game has become a joke  Look how ridiculously HIGH are prices of decks and how BLATANTLY LOW is the chance to get a playable card  It s like after a year of free to play you can afford like a fuckin zoolock at its finest  but how can you compete such decks like an interactive OTK combo without any counter pick  The 2nd winner award goes to idiot warriors  players  I don t mind playing against pirate warrior as it s easy to tech against  but my dear God this Quest warrior brings only hatred  It s almost the same shit as with the Skillgate mage apart from you are unable to hit face at any means  Every single turn he plays 23 taunts  just watched today a legend rank stream and only Quest warrior mirrors  I don t know who did design the new collection but give me a job in Blizz and I will do more balanced and enjoyable cards  This as it s now will only lead to many older players getting tired and quitting the game\", \"commentId\": \"35211\", \"commentDate\": \"1492013113\"}, {\"comment\": \"Yea Warrior is just the worst  I fucking hate Warriors

minions  Do they not see how inconsistent a deck is with that requirement The murloc dude with deathrattle dies instantly when your opponent sees it so all you have are a bunch of suicidal 11s and maybe some random fragile neutrals that die along with the buffs  And no  divine favor will not help against aggro decks but vs control decks you do indeed draw cards but the reward is just useless  I mean come on Kappazzard    5 mana 55 with no guaranteed value mass dispel  yes ive seen it  brawl  devolve  freezed constantly vs mage  rogues kill your ass before u even get half the quest  etc Lets make a comparisonWarrior  rag hero power  beautiful Rogue  do i need to say something here Shaman  get murlocs like europe gets refugees Priest  got some of that good ol vitamin Health Warlock  ok this quest is a little difficult but infinite value nonetheless Druid  BIG BOAIS GALOOORE BABY yea u die before u complete it but hey theres still jades Mage  The Dahaka may be pissed at jaina for
