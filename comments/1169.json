for making hs the greatest and most balanced game ever  Blizzard  Here I was trying to play my control deck  shit scared of other control decks with no overpowered cards and  all of a sudden  when I reach level 8 all I play against is huntard and shamoron  Its a relief when I see my opponents drop a 3rd turn 77 turd that costs 4 or almost killing me by turn 4 if they have a regular hand  theres nothing like unop cards  Anyway  who wants to spend money on a game that is fair or original Screw that  theres no such rush as playing against the same two decks after level 8 and lose 88 of the time  Winning is for pussies  so I love to lose  especially when Im outskilled by a 5th turn kill no matter what 67 of the times  Yeah  I did the math  bc the game is so fair that I even dedicated 30 minutes of my life doing it  Cant wait to spend a whole bunch more of my hard earned money on hs  Screw unoriginal and limited games like MTG  whoever plays that is obviously sick of winning games  thats what happens when there are literally hundreds of viable decks instead of 2\", \"commentId\": \"24444\", \"commentDate\": \"1471660591\"}, {\"comment\": \"Nerf Molten Giant  a card used in multiple archetypes  most of which required some thought to play and play around   Introduce Arcane Giant  which rewards decks that are already good with free or cheap 88s  and enhances some nice
