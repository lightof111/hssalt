idiots would play  but self playing Jade deck gut him the lucky win after a nice Lavaburst topdeck  Hearthstone is such a fucking faggotgame now  Why am I even playing this shit again  WHY I was never

\"Thank you blizzard for offering us such a thought provoking gaming experience  After each and every game I become a better person   Each one of my opponents top decks teaches me the value of 80 skill vs 20 luck  I learn that discipline  order and meticulous game planning mean absolute zero fuckass shit  considering how my opponents simply puke out cards  throw them on the board and win  with as little thinking as possible   Drafting netdecks is an absolute bliss  Having an amazing selection of 30 OP cards feels so rewarding especially when you mulligan fuck all   A game of fun  exciting twists and turns that lasts an AMAZYING 23 turns as you watch your opponent curve out his best opening while you sit back  relax and enjoy the bag of dicks in your mouth   RNGSTONE WE LOVE YOU\",

mechanic  always the same sh  When winning is more important than having fun and youre not a pro player  there is a problem  What is the point of winning turn five  We all know the best games are the one where you struggle  When you crush somebody with a op deck  there is no pleasure    because it was easy  Theres no glory to succeed that way  For my part  i concede turn one against quest rogue because i dont give a damn AND i dont play ranked  Thats the other confusing thing    why play op deck when winning is not that important  Non ladder should be the occasion to test fun decks and not play the same boring deck     Well  I guess Im salty but i have to admit im gonna stop playing this game because of the way most players are  Between stupid decks and bad manners  i had enough  Its
