me  a very budget cthun priest because i dont have the expansions nor the legendaries to succeed  and kept spamming emotes whenever he had an answer to EVERY SINGLE THING i had on the board  whenever i played a nova he would use the oops emote and just refill his fucking board with low cost minions  but i guess thats zoolock right then after i lose on turn 7 AS A PRIEST  MIND YOU  he friends me and starts trashtalking me and my deck  then without even letting me respond he unfriends me  what a cunt  i think his name was MurkySC or MurkyRC or something  i cant remember  so fucking stupid how blizz is pushing this aggro style setting while at the same time saying OMG CHARGE 2 OP LO COST CHARG NED NURF  all the while leaving cards like imp gang boss not even sure why this card was added in the first place when warlock at the time had excellent early game and FUCKING ABUSIVE SERGEANT plz blizzard kill this card next expansion to roam around the majority of decks in the meta  blizzard is

that decks like Midrange Shaman and Hunter  and Aggro decks decks that dont have card draw draw much better then Control and Midrange decks that do have draw mechanics  You can argue thats because of the way they build their deck  but seriously  how often does Shaman NOT open with Tunnel Trogg I mean  when I play Control Warrior I mulligan for Fiery War Axe when Im against Aggro and I get in less then 33 of the time thats at least 6 cards you can get it in  but how do they always have Fiery Bat Tunnel Trogg Mana Wyrm etc  Maybe Im just unlucky that my opponent gets it everytime against me  but
