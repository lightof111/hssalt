your losses  When you do that  you dont really learn or develop or get better at the game   Yes  sometimes you lose to RNG  but thats only sometimes  Most of the time you lose because you made a critical mistake  Youll find you lose to RNG a lot less when you learn what to expect and how to counter or prevent it\", \"commentId\": \"28369\", \"commentDate\": \"1480181395\"}, {\"comment\":

because its nice to commiserate with other players who feel like theyre getting screwed  In the beginning of the season youll be facing a lot of players who belong at much higher ranks and youre going to lose a lot unless you belong there too  Thats why it gets easier to ladder at the end of the month  all the best players are at rank 5 or above by now  But this guy cant get out of his own way  He refuses to play competitive decks and gets mad when he loses games  then he blames all of his losses on RNG  In reality  RNG losses happen but most of our losses are because we made a mistake somewhere  Hearthstone is simple on the surface  but the games can get pretty complicated and if youre not treating it like a chess game its going to get super frustrating  You cant be surprised when you load up your board with cheap minions and it gets cleared with a lightning storm  Thats a favorable topdeck  but its not the reason you lost  You lost because you overcommitted when you should have known he most likely has a lightning storm in his deck  You cant get salty when you play against a hunter and attack with your high value minion while he has a secret up and your minion gets frost trapped  Thats your fault for not activating the secret with another minion first\", \"commentId\": \"28371\", \"commentDate\": \"1480182014\"}, {\"comment\": \"Whenever I play cw I always put

each totem  1 on trogg  1 on face Now this is an example of an extremely bad case of early RNG  First  the totem RNG from the hero power was extremely crucial to the board  on turn 2  Second  the flamewaker missing was also extremely crucial to the board  on turn 3  Thats just not acceptable and with Mage and Shaman being two top classes with extremely heavy early RNG elements  it turns the game into a big steaming dump for a lot of people  Wheres the skill in rolling a spell damage totem Nowhere  You just sometimes get it when you need it and win  randomly Ive always said the shaman power should cycle through totems  Theres no reason to have it be random  it adds nothing at all to the game\", \"commentId\": \"28374\", \"commentDate\": \"1480182844\"}, {\"comment\": \"I appreciate

dunno what happened to my Game in the last match Played as a dragon warrior vs a hunter  and did quite fine  I had some luck in the early game  for he wasnt able to pull off any insane amount of face damage  Also got the Hunter Hero Power from Sir Finley  which isnt exactly the best choice in general  but the other options were rather poor Shaman and Priest  if I remember correctly  Then I drew Alexstraszas Champion on turn 7  Played it  cleared his board and got ready to attack Alexs Champion was active  I got Drakonid Crusher in my hand  waiting  but Hearthstone just didnt want to let me click on Alexs Champ  With my other minions I could attack just as normal  but Alextraszas Champion didnt allow it  I tried it until the rope ended my turn  so I missed my first 3 damage there  Next turn I played curator which allowed me to take a bit less care of his board which at that point was a Savannah Highmane only  having my face well protected behind Curator and Fierce Monkey  Therefore I continued to go face with my other minions  Alextraszas Champion still didnt allow me to get any use of it though  again 3 damage gone  making me miss 6 damage in total  I actually tried to reconnect in this turn  noticing that this amount of lost damage was going to become a huge problem  but it didnt help  He then cleared my Taunts with UTH and the Highmane  leaving up only a Book Wyrm I had since Turn 6 and the lazy Alexstraszas Champion  I then topdecked Blackwing Corruptor  it was active  so I had the potential of directly dealing 8 damage to the face 3 from Corruptor  3 from Book Wyrm and 2 from the Hero Power  Well  obviously this wasnt quite enough  since he was still at 17  so there was exactly 9 damage missing  Wait  9 damage Oh  right 3 Turns  3 missed attacks of Alexs Champion  339  am I right  However  this wasnt possible  So I tried to adapt myself and play a bit more defensive  which turned out to not matter at all  as in his next turn he simply played Leeroy  Quick Shot  HP  Recapping this game  I think I have done at least some weak decisions in my plays  but nevertheless  the salt is real with that one\", \"commentId\": \"28377\",
