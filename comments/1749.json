misplays than you think  you have a chance to improve   When you just write off every loss as bad draws  you wont consider what you could have done differently  and wont improve   I dont know what rank you are playing at  but with a decent deck  I have never even lost 10 in a row  And I have been to legend 9 times  so it is not just because I troll around at rank 20  Just a little advice

\"I am salty about the way we get matched up  dont tell me its random and vs someone of similar rank only  My druid deck is 2312 at the moment  not particularly impressive however I am 08 against mage  08 I got on a nice win streak at the start then I had 4 mages in a row  I play mage sometimes so Im not moaning that the class is OP   I know its nicely balanced but I am moaning because its the one archetype that crushes me no matter what  PS If you hate aggro druid just tech in volcanic potions and discover any kind of aoe from glyph   Anyway I put it down to bad luck   go on another win streak   then again just had 3 mages in a row followed by taunt warrior luckily not seen much of that cancer followed by yet another mage  It seems like the game will halt my progress for me no matter
