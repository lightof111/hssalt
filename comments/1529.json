I remember when I used to play Cthun Warrior  or Freeze Mage  or even Zoo Warlock  This is were you REALLY get to show how good you are  but now  you just lost by turn 4 or 5 if  you dont get a 1 drop or a 2 drop  I know some of you may say Youre just salty  The meta has changed or shit like that  but am I really the nly one whos sick of this stuff Im seriously considering quit HearthStone and focus more on other things  so what do you guys say\", \"commentId\": \"32110\", \"commentDate\": \"1486693226\"}, {\"comment\": \"Its really getting annoying    Its either fuckface pirate decks that are unbeatable OR fuckface Reno decks which are unbeatble   Real fucking good   Midrange decks are DEAD and they are the most fun to play and play against   Fuck drawn out  boring games with asshole

there  but Blizzard has shown expansion after expansion that they couldnt care less about game balance  and more specifically arena balance  So fuck it  Im just so fucking sick and tired of queueing up at fucking awful records like 41  72  etc and facing the godliest arena decks ever drafted  piloted by some drooling inbred piece of shit that gets rewarded for misplays  Some losses feel completely unavoidable despite making the correct play every turn  I hate that skill doesnt mean shit anymore  theres no room to outplay your opponent so wins feels cheapened  as the game is essentially over by turn 3 in most cases  The only way to maintain an 8 average is to retire decks constantly  its just gotten retarded  Good luck to everyone that has faith in Blizzard and is going
