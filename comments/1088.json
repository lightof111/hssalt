"[{\"comment\": \"People keep crying about shaman  face shaman deserves the hate  But midrange shaman takes some thinking mainly due to overload  at least more than a lot of top tier decks pirate warrior  tempo mage  zoo  and midrange hunter to name a few  I do agree that there are some bs shaman cards 4 mana 77 but every class has some bs cards Call of the wild  ice block  sap  and Cthun ffs     You may say this is the wrong forum for this but I get genuinely upset when people shit on Shaman they deserve some shit    more than any other class  Mage and Hunter have only been getting more annoying and priest while it is weak is so aggravating to play against  pls dont hate  just blowing off steam\", \"commentId\": \"22702\", \"commentDate\": \"1468439299\"}, {\"comment\": \"This game is so fcking frustrating  After quite a few mediocre Arena runs i had the Chance to go to 12 wins again  Went 90 first  But then 93  First big Frustration  Rewards 160 Gold and 2 shitty Cards  Second big Frustration  In my Card pack i got a legendary  finally after 35 WOG packs without  It was the Shaman legendary  AGAIN  Got him for the 4th or 5th time  From 12 legendaries i got so far i got 5

think the free 55 is way more op than the 77  because the 77 gives them overload to deal with  Its cthun warrior that I think is the most brainless deck in the meta  That 66 ten armor shieldbearer is such bs  There are ways to deal with shaman minions or weapons  But theres nothing to fight warriors infinite armor infinite removal  I have golden warrior and I hate playing vs cthuncw the most  I think its cheating\", \"commentId\": \"22712\", \"commentDate\": \"1468457530\"}, {\"comment\": \"I hate bad luck so much\", \"commentId\": \"22713\", \"commentDate\": \"1468461361\"}, {\"comment\":

hits the target that is the worst for me 3 times in a row  9 targets  hits the only devastating target for me 2 times in a row  I mean he played Chillmaw and the random spell is mulch on my Savannah when there are 9 targets and my Savannah is my only card that can contest the board and take out Chillmaw  Played another Savannah in another game  random spell is naturalize  Play a big minion in another game  it gets corrupted  Finally get a decent starting hand and can play a Kings Ellek as opener  random spell is Starfall on my Kings Ellek  Opponent has 4 minions I have 0  random spell is sap on AN EMPTY TARGET shouldnt even be fucking  possible   I mulliganed 3 legendaries above 7 cost as well as the obligatory savannah highmane in starting hand  didnt receive anything better than a 3 drop  My last game was just unbelieavable see screenshots  My opponent plays the Ooze thing that gives him two 12s on turn 1  gets 3 webspinners for free  He now has 9 worth of stats on turn 1  I coin out spidertank  random spell Shadowstrikes a 12  He plays peacekeeper on my spidertank and goes face and I play a Kings Ellek which gives Velens Chosen to give my spidertank the 3 power back so I can use him to kill his peacekeeper at least  What does opponent play then He plays ANOTHER fucking peacekeeper on my spidertank  Wait  it gets better  the second peacekeeper gives him the random spell Burgle which gives him a fucking BESTIAL WRATH that he can play on perfect curve the same turn to spend all his mana to clear my biggest threat for free without damaging his minions with his fucking BEAST SYNERGY that he now has as a paladin  Are you fucking kidding me Havent won a brawl yet  lost like 5 in a row  Deceptively fun game for sure  with emphasis on the deceptive part  Jesus Christ  As if that werent bad enough  my bad luck continued as I spent like 15 minutes trying to upload 3 screenshots on this crappy site with its shitty interface and unknown errors  In the end all I can conjure up is a fucking link to this ant picture  enjoy  httpss32 postimg org84ejut241IMG5186 png\", \"commentId\": \"22716\", \"commentDate\": \"1468467811\"}, {\"comment\": \"Still cant play the
