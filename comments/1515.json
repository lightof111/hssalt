1 with stupid pirates  and if you survive turn 1 try to make it to turn 6 lol  If they dont kill you on turn 6 they can always topdeck 77 or more jades or more burn  Or they play a 3 mana 2020  Auctioneer ius most definatly not the problem  it is just a 44  the card draw also requires cards to be sacrificed and if you only have a bit of skill you know how to play around gadgetzan conceal  If it is about jade druid it is still not broken without jade idol it would actually be bad because the fatigue temselves too fast\", \"commentId\": \"31815\", \"commentDate\": \"1486037520\"},

surpassed the 40 mark  and during the last few hours before the ladder resets  Shaman numbers were nearing 60  While Aggro Shaman has increased in popularity  the bigger spike came from MidJade Shaman

you play a smalltime  gain a 11 charge free and can kill a coined Doomsayer in turn 2 with axe  To cause 4 damage with undertaker you need 3 other minions and turn 3 or 4  to cause 4 damage with a smalltime you only need a weapon 3  1 from free patches  is like a minion 1 mana 43 battlecry cause 1 damage  killing in turn 4 or 5 before is very hard  now is common  Thinking about  anything in this game history is garbage in comparison  try play wild and see how many pirate warrior will find there\", \"commentId\": \"31828\", \"commentDate\": \"1486058322\"}, {\"comment\": \"The old Undertaker face hunter and also undertaker Zoo would eat Pirate warrior for breakfast  Going first means that on turn two you have a 34 Undertaker and two 1 drop deathrattle minons  With weapon on turn 2  you can trade with your small time buccaneer and Patches or weapon and you will have to trade or lose  but he has still 2 minions on board  Or a 23 and a 2drop but you still need to hit  undertaker with your weapon or buccaneer otherwise you will inevitably lose   Going second  you play undertaker coin Deathrattle and have immediately a turn 1 23 including snowball and 1drop  Same thing  pirate warrior must trade or lose  while hunter can start face action  Plus the hero power is already the ideal face one  Small time buccaneer is a very good aggressive minion  but it is like a flame imp and cant snowball  It will only do 3 damage per turn and will always only have 2 health  Old undertaker was way more dangerous\", \"commentId\": \"31829\", \"commentDate\": \"1486059692\"},
