of all lets remember the posts from the TGT pack opening along with the old gods one  This was my last years rant about my luck considering TGT packs REALLY BLIZZARD REALLY I opened 40 hard earned packs from the expansion day 1 and till the day that came out I also open one each day  That makes 25    which is 65 overall   ONLY one fuckin legendary  ONE Lets talk about Old Gods REALLY BLIZZARDREALLY I opened 37 hard earned packs from the expansion day 1 plus the 13 you gave us plus 4 more during the first days of the expansion  We are talking about 54 packs overall  1 fE legendary again  1   The stupid Priest one  Most of the people I know and opened around 50 packs had at least 3 and even more  So this year I was kinda demotivated with the game so I have opened only 35 packs so far  Yeah I know the number is not that great but I know MANY people who opened from 1 to 3 legendaries among 30 or near 30  How many did I open Zero  So during the last 3 expansions  I opened 154 packs in their first days only to get 2 legendaries out of them\", \"commentId\": \"28977\", \"commentDate\": \"1480991864\"}, {\"comment\": \"No thats not the reason  Its because some people just play this game to get fast wins and get to higher ranks  they dont care if they play cancer or not and they dont play for fun  You forgot about mid range shaman already what were they countering there were no jade decks back then  Also on a note  idk why people here think that jade druid is broken  I never lost a single match against them since the expansion started  I play as renolock  reno priest  and dragon priest  They are the slowest deck on earth  you can beat them with a deck from the classic set    seems like people just believe the hype and never see whats really infront of them\",

druids  Kept running into these neckbearded shits all the time  Oh  but rogue is too fast for a jade druid  youll say  WRONG Decent draws are too fast for jade druid  but meanwhile I had curse after curse  not getting any jade generators nor NZoth  or if I could put some scary golems out there  then my opponent get whatever they need to piss on that and shit out their jade auctioneer combo  And why would you play Naturalize in a nonmill deck anyways not like it helped me to draw any better  And surprise  if it wasnt jade druid  it was CThun druid  possibly the most boring and uninspiring druid deck ever  without trying any single Gadgetzan or even Karazhan card  I won that much  but come on  Cthun druid With all the potentially fun cards and shit you can try  you choose the most boring archetype ever invented well  besides anyfin pally But hell  what am I talking about When a druid tries out something new  I find out an ultra greedy druid Im winning with ease despite him drawing answers once more like crazy  just to get AvianaKunAlexstrasza on my faceMalygosFaceless ManipulatorStarfire on my face for 15 damageHmmm  well played  The craziest combo ever given to druid  and you use it to make another bulshit OTK deck  thanks Malfurion  I really hope you die in a hole full of your own shit  you shirtless scumbag prick\", \"commentId\": \"28989\", \"commentDate\":
