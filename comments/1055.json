"[{\"comment\": \"I think I mightve had the most soulcrushing loss just now  I was playing against a CThun Priest with Yogg Mage on mobile  I had him in lethal range but I got that stupid Hero Power bug on mobile which covered my Hero Power with my cards  All because of that  he was able to heal up with 2 Twilight Darkmenders  Just when I finally secured the board with Summoning Stone after punching through a Twin Emperor Veklor  he played a YoggSaron that he stole off my Thoughtsteal which cleared my board and gave him two Spirit Wolves before I got disconnected because fuck mobile\",
