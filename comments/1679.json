I hope they nerf it to 33 minimal  55 is just way too op to have 4x charging 55s in 1 turn  Like come on guys  patron warrior much Dont you guys learn anything there at Blizzard HQ Or are you guys too busy shoveling the money in the vault labeled HS players we fucked Fuck off you quest rogues  Come up with something original than all use the same netdeck  Look what has become of Hearthstone    Every new expansion somehow Blizzard creates an OP deck  one player perfects it  Thousands follow to play it exactly the same to get some fast brainless wins   While in the meantime when you wanna have fun and play a nice deck  Standard Impossible due to pirate warriors  quest rogues Wild Impossible due to jade druid  quest rogues  pirate warriors Casual Impossible due to failing pirate warriors and quest rogues  Whatever gamemode I turn to I might get off a win or two  But all I come across are the same boring netdecks  The times where you had a fun long match with some randomness

believe that Blizzard IS messing with the matchmaking to suit their business purposes based on the contents of the decks you play  even though they vehemently deny it and youll be accused of being a conspiracy theorist wearing a tinfoil hat for saying it  People dont want to believe they have been conned so will argue Blizzards lie for them  Blizzard dont want to be sued implicit in selling cards for money is the understanding that cards in your deck will be drawn randomly  and that matchups will be determined as advertised ie randomly based upon rank  It often seems that neither of those things are true  It would be a fairly simple thing to test  statistically  with the right experimental design  something that would be a nice graduate level project  and it might lead to a nice
