absolutely tilting me about it If others agree  I may reach out to Blizzard for an update on this  I play Mage 99 9 of my ranked games and love the play style  You can imagine how stoked I was to see the new cardsquest released  I started building my deck a week ago just to prep leaving space for new cards I was intending to implement of course  I suddenly had this burst of genius after watching one of the UnGoro release streams cant remember exactly which one where one of the Blizzard guys was clear about the wording on quest cards i e  Play vs Summon  Now  Mage is the only one with a quest card that uses the key term Cast to activate the quest  The official text for Open the Waygate is Cast 6 spells that didnt start in your deck  Reward Time Warp  So reading this  a light bulb goes off in my head  Servent of YoggSaron will cast a spell worth 5 or less on Battlecry 2 free spells not from my deck while playing a 54 minion  all for 5 mana  Can you say value town For those who dont know  Servent of YoggSarons ability reads as follows Cast a random spell that costs 5 or less targets chosen randomly  Now  imagine how excited I was yesterday to play my new Mage deck after adding in all the new cards I got in packscrafted  Im in my first game  26 spells towards my quest when i hit turn 6 and have a chance to play Servent of YoggSaron  Servent comes onto the board  casts a spell  but my count towards the quest doesnt go up WTF HOLD UP  WHAT The quest says Cast 6 spells that didnt start in your deck and Servent Casted a spell that I did not have in my deck to start    Um  hello Is this John Blizzard Yeah  we need to talk about your word choice Alright  I got my emotions out  but seriously though I would like to see if we can get Blizzard to either adjust the quest to say Play 6 spells that didnt start in your deck or have Servent of YoggSarons spell count towards the quest  Any fellow players out there that think this change should be made or can elaborate on why it shouldnt count\", \"commentId\": \"34776\", \"commentDate\": \"1491573053\"}, {\"comment\": \"Because its not you that cast the spell  the Servant of YoggSaron did  Same as YoggSaron himself  though he really shouldnt give you overload  That was one change that made no sense  Speaking of sense  I am really enjoying the new expansion but there is one card that just needs to disappear  Edwin VanCleef  Rogues got a very good quest  but they are still manageable  However  losing simply because they have that one card in hand is really dumb  They play a 3 mana 88 and you better play a deck with an answer  and a class that can even get one  or youre done  At least the 4 mana 77 cost you tempo\", \"commentId\": \"34777\", \"commentDate\": \"1491573498\"}, {\"comment\": \"DAMMIT  Everyone   EVERYONE I
