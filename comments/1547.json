and a common card Even if I didnt have the card  it doesnt change the fact that it really represents one pack and 5 dust i the long run  aka even worse rewards than 0 wins  Blizz talks this big game about changes  but nothing was said about arena reward system  giving you cards based on the crafting value  Literally the worst issue in Hearthstone right now  even worse than the polarizing meta

once in while you could kill my Mad Scientist    Or waste 2 damage on that Acolyte of Pain the stupid Warrior refuses to kill cause god forbid he wastes 3 damage to prevent me from drawing more     Why why does Bloodsail Cultist have to have 4 HP I mean isnt it enough that they always have her on turn 3 to buff their stupid weapon Or why all of sudden everyone seems to be playing Southsea
