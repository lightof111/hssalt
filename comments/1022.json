as a 50 chance or less  Not like Im always losing to those  but come on  it has been several games in a row  when I play CThun decks  I either have to dig like a mole for that fucker  or I get it at

\"Not sure what to tell you but crafting a good original deck that can function properly is tremendously difficult  And note that I say Original  As for other Boulderfist Ogres Frostwolfs and such    Why would they bother when they can use class oriented cards that most of the time work better    As for CThun  I love the idea behind the deck but the issue is when CThun is often somewhere deep in the lowest realms of your deck so you often die before you draw himAt least in my experience  It is what it is  Im trying Leeroyfree Miracle Rogue  Freeze MageWhich I adore hate me as much as you want CThun Druid from time to time   It is just what it is  I almost miss Control Warlock decks  If you cant stand to play against Aggro     Become Aggro then\", \"commentId\": \"21331\", \"commentDate\":
