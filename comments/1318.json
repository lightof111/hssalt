well  turn 4 he has nothing against my 2 Feral Spirit tokens and Whirling Zapomatic at 21 life while i have Bloodlust in hand  Drops the Excavated Evil  Alright  i can repopulate the board  he drops a Piloted Shredder  I go for the win and play totem  Infested Tauren  He drops Shadow Word Horror  trades his Shredder into my Jungle Panther  Shredder drops Doomsayer  Due to me having a Nerubian Egg  I can maintain some form of board presence  however his topdecked Kvaldir Raider threatens to end the game as i have no out to it He also plays Mind Vision  I am trying to play as much as possible  and due to him somehow not healing his raider  i can come back using Bloodlust and Cult Master  After some trading with him staying in the game due to having a Cult Master off Mind Vision and me getting owned by Master of Evolution turning my Tomb Spider into a Bolvar Fordragon  i finally have him out of cards on a 2 turn clock  He topdecks a Jeweled Scarab  discovers a Thoughtsteal  into his Excavated Evil and my Volcanic Drake  forcing me to waste my accumulated Rockbiter Weapon and Lava Shock in order to keep my last minion  which leads to him winning in fatigue due to having a Sea
