some ladder  But after 2 hours going from 6 rank 2 wins to 6 rank 3 wins I have only 1 question  wtf I am doing wrong D I am not a bad player  each season I go to rank 5 or more without pirate warrior D but this time I am stuck between rank 6  The decks I play are quest rogue  quest warrior  midrangeface hunter  elemental shaman  These decks seem to be ok but when i hit rank 6 5 stars and need only 1 win to go rank 5 I loose like 3 games and there we go again   can anyone explain what the hell is wrong with this game btw I am playing HS for almost 2 years\", \"commentId\": \"35294\",

phenomenal overall win rate approaching 70  thats still an insane number of games you have to play to climb  especially after rank 5 where you cant chain into additional stars  Honestly  Im perfectly happy to reach rank 15 for a months effort  and have never failed to do that within the first week of each new month  and with only a couple of hours extra effort past just fulfilling daily quests  This month  just before UnGoro launched  I had some terrible luck  and failed 4 times to win that one extra game that would have pushed me over the rank 15 hump  Now  since UnGoro  Ive had the hardest struggle since ever in trying to just get beyond rank 18  I fell all the way back to rank 19 when trying out my new decks  Ive never seen such a rockpaperscissors metagame before  Ive never been so good at predicting the outcome as soon as the hero matchup has been revealed  Forgone conclusions just     suck  Decks that I planned out for the new year have turned out to be jokes in the face of Quest Warrior and Quest Rogue  Id rather face Pirate Warrior than either of these decks ever again  Yesterday  over the course of 11 games  all I faced were Quest Warrior and Quest Rogue  How is that even possible In desperation  Ive just today switched to playing only Face Hunter and Zoolock for ranked matches in an attempt to just get to rank 15  Am at 17 as I type this  after winning about 60 against Quest Rogue and about 33 against Quest Warrior  Probably wont be able to play again until tomorrow  Am starting to worry that even rank 15 is beyond me     for the first time ever\",
