card is objectively the most annoying card in the entire game  Its not that RNG is the worst thing to me  its that every deck can use him and hes usually pretty good  I play a Reno mage  and its a pretty good game  he yoggs and it doesnt feel so bad  He is only playing one ofs and has lots of spells in his deck  it makes sense  The next game is against an average warrior who isnt even playing that many spells and he happens to have the two craziest fucking Yoggs thank you shadowstep I have seen in a while  basically clearing the board and refilling his hand  As far as I can tell he wasnt playing some OTK deck not much draw or Thaurissan  he just through it in there because it will probably win you 50 of the games alone  And If I feel like Yogg shouldnt even be in Control Warrior because it usually draws a ton of cards  which I thought was usually a negative thing in Control warrior and was part of the reason Varian Wrinn didnt see much play  Oh well  I guess traditional game plans change when you have a 10mana board clear and fill your hand card available  I guess the worst part of Yogg for me is that when I see it played Im never excited  it never feels like a fun and interactive card  Even if I win off of Yogg  its not satisfying  its just sad\", \"commentId\": \"26300\", \"commentDate\": \"1474756510\"}, {\"comment\": \"I have 8 cards in my hand  homebrew deck
