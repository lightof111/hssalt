games in a row  vs 2 paladins and 1 warrior when I have lethal next turn they drop Reno Jackson     I was salty af for like 10 minutes  I just love how the match making picks bullshit decks against me  One of the paladins healed over 9000 damage  he dropped reno at 14 HP coinreno on turn 5 and then the horse  healed for 8 lay on hands  and then on turn 8 healed with lay on hands  then turn 9 tirion  then dropped happy rag and healed for another 8 at turn 10  then true silver my face twice for 4 healing  Cant tell you how much salt I was having at that game  he stayed alive at 5 hp and then I conceded because I had enough of his bullshit godly draws and RNG  he is playing 1 card of each in his deck and it was like a normal control paladin match    he had reno  wild pyro  equity in his opening hand  then tirion and happy rag  like are you kidding me\", \"commentId\": \"26751\", \"commentDate\": \"1475796990\"}, {\"comment\": \"I just ran into a guy who has snowchugger and faceless
