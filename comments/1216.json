silver hand recruit 33 from uldaman  and he has nothing  He pays brawl leaving me with a frostwolf grunt which he moat lurkers  next turn he plays force tank  then another moat lurker on a 55 i had

for like 15 minutes and he builded a fun Fatigue Mage deck with the new card Malchezaar  He played against a druid  The druid kept drawing cards and cards and at one point he had 10 cards in hand without Savjz doing anything  Taking that chance Savjz dropped 2x Coldlight and let him overdraw  Guess what the druid did next He just did draw more cards and eventually milled himself again  His deck was empty  he sat on low health and dropped 2x Arcane Giants  which Savjz could handle with his spells  Then of course the Druid dropped Yogg and Yogg shadowstepped himself again  while drawing no cards whatsoever out of 15 spells  which already is very unlikely  The second time he dropped him next turn he once again did not draw one card and actually got lucky to the point that Savjz was dead next turn  Thats it  I closed the stream  I think given that this happend on rank 2 it baffles my mind how in thw world a player such as bad as this druid player can be at this rank  I mean it was terrible  I dont want to see that tbh  I think this is a problem  Usually tournaments and whatnot were somewhat fun to watch  because you could see that someone really understands what he or she is doing and wins because of knowledge and experience and simply the better plays  With Yogg all of that is gone  Gone  Its not of intrest anymore  If someone wins because of this card  even if played as bad as one can  then all of the sudden this game has no value anymore\", \"commentId\": \"25505\", \"commentDate\": \"1473232261\"}, {\"comment\": \"So  I found this pally deck  an anyfin reno
