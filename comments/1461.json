to rank up with a sub50 win rate Last season I casually ranked to 6 with a terrible dragon priest homebrew  I think you should play a different deck because its basically the hardest deck to play  Its just as hard to play as Reno Mage  but you dont even have any burst win potential AND you cant even defend against burst with ice block  reno Its a very clunky and bad deck that basically relies on Draonid Operative and Dragonfire Potion to do anything I loved playing it but eventually just got sick of being bursted down by every deck  Every class has better removal and burst  The only thing you get is nearinfinite value and that doesnt do anything when you dont have Reno  Ice Block in the current state of hearthstone  Sad\", \"commentId\": \"30667\", \"commentDate\": \"1483842198\"}, {\"comment\": \"This partially sums up what I think is wrong with Hearthstone currently and probably is the source of a lot of my salt   It no longer feels like player input has anything to do with the outcome   You have Deck A which will win a certain percentage of the time against Deck B  and on practically every turn there is a clear and obvious best play   It just feels like going through the motions  if a deck has a certain percent winrate  it will get that almost regardless of player input  because of the clear best play   The only thing that really changes is what cards you draw and when   The only part of the game that feels remotely interactive is the mulligan  and even THAT is a bit of a crapshoot   Sure I could grind a deck to rank 5 pretty easily  but whats even the point when decks basically play themselves\", \"commentId\": \"30668\", \"commentDate\": \"1483844277\"}, {\"comment\": \"So I made a Renolock in response to my meltdown on the previous page yesterday
