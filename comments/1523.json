since Undertaker days  I guess  Although Im not a pro nor a tryhard player  I dedicated a lot of time to this game and even me lost quite a bit of interest in HS  Having said that  every season I grind at least for the rank 5 reward but the most rewarding thing is defeating aggro Shaman and pirate Warrior Worth a note as a Dragon Priest player I get frustrated by both aggro AND Reno decks  The mere fact that you can only grind with one or another RIP nonShaman Midrange decks speaks volumes about our current poor meta\", \"commentId\": \"31985\", \"commentDate\": \"1486399882\"}, {\"comment\": \"I get unreasonably upset whenever someone plays Betrayal  or any other extremely situational card  Like  whenever it works  I can just imagine the other person using that as justification for putting it in their deck and feeling proud of themselves  But thats not how card games  or general life decision making works  just because something worked out doesnt mean it was correct to do  The opposite is also true   Really wish I could just stop playing this game but I dont want to lose on the free value of dailies in case I ever want to come back  Its so frustrating playing with less intelligent people  Watching someone with a legend cardback play extremely slowly and poorly is the biggest facepalm  Legend has never been a legitimate accomplishment  its a symbol that you dedicated an embarrassing amount of time to this game in one month  This game has never rewarded skill and it likely never will  Even though I got mine the one month I played 20 hours  I never use it because I think its a joke\", \"commentId\": \"31986\", \"commentDate\": \"1486401511\"}, {\"comment\": \"wild is so fun right now i thought it would get better at lower ranks BUT THIS IS

you  or otherwise doesnt play around it  Which no one does anyway  exactly because its unplayed  in an inadvertendly punishing way  it becomes crushing  A very overlooked card IMO  In any of my  gimmicky  admittedly  control rogues  its a staple  However  theres a simple trick not to be caught off guard  Play around it  Most complaints around Betrayal would be solved that way\",

placement  also good against Powershot Jokes aside  I get the frustration when you get wrecked by it  and I also agree that playing around it has advantages  Good placement has virtually no downside  makes you practice your strategic thinking a rare commodity in this meta and saves you from when your opponent actually does have betrayal Jokes aside again  it may not be relevant on standard ladder
