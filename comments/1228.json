everyone else is playing in casual too to keep up with whats going on in all the classes because I dont have time to keep up with everything myself  I play what I think is the strongest deck at the moment considering all factors in ladder  because I dont want to play in the double digits too long in the beginning of the season against weaker players playing noninnovative decks in an uninteresting way  Every single time I win  Im sure my opponent thinks Im a lucky mindless netdecking idiot asshole  I dont play well every single match  but in more than a year of playing every single day  Ive never met the player who said something complimentary after losing  I sympathize with a lot of the feelings on this thread  but Im pretty sure that the pervasive belief that everyone else is a retard is pretty fucking retarded\", \"commentId\": \"25751\", \"commentDate\": \"1473618305\"}, {\"comment\": \"i dont give a fuck about legend   just rank 5   of course  lets try secrete

more Aggro and coinflip shit while removing all Anti Aggro cards like Healbot and Deathlord and replaced them with crap cards like Cult Apocathery and Cyclopian Horror Before standard you had different archetypes  Midrange mainly Secret Paladin  Control mainly WarriorPriest and some Aggro Decks like Hunter or Zoo  Now you have Aggro Warrior  Aggro Paladin  Aggro Zoolock  Midrange Hunter and of course Aggro Shaman  And their tools are so broken by now that you cant even survive to turn 10 unless you are playing this shit yourself or put your deck full of healing and removals  And
