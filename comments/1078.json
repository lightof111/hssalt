because you thought you were clever by farming easy wins with aggro cancer  And I am not going to have the discussion again why aggro is cancer and braindead  because Ive had that one plenty of times  All the faggro players uninstall right now  You play to win instead of to have fun  Its not like youre going pro anyway  Why do you still play this game Just to win Just to play your cards every turn

this game is YoggSaron  Hopes End  A horrible card  completely relying on RNG  Can end up rewarding the player for literally doing nothing or playing horribly in a certain game  If we look at it from a statistical point of view  theres actually a bigger chance to get a good outcome out of Yogg when playing it  than a bad one  Games I really enjoy  even if I lose them  are games where both me and
