\"Okay  what the fuck  I went to cue a game and before the game could even find me someone it disconnects me from the Hearthstone server  I immediately log back in only to be met with a You lost your last ranked game due to a disconnect  When it had literally been seconds from the time of disconnecting to the time of getting back into the game  On top of that I was at rank 12  disconnected and log back in to see Im now at rank 13  missing 2 stars  How in the fucking hell did I disconnect and lose 2 stars from one game that never started  What the fuck is wrong with you  I literally spent 30 minutes getting to rank 12 only to have it undone in a matter of seconds by some shitty glitch with the server  Edit Fuck it  Im too urked about loosing my stars for no reason  to even bother playing again  Ill log in for the rewards but Im probably not going to bother playing ranked until UnGoro releases in 6 days  You should NOT loose stars if a game hasnt found you an opponent yet and if it has it should at least give you a chance to get back into the game instead of just automatically forcing a loss  Nothings wrong with my internet connection  nothings wrong with my PC and there was no disconnect from Battle net so I dont know whats up  I dont have a huge amount of time to play between exam week coming up and the slew of assignments Ive been dealing with since my professors dont know how to space things out and seem to think that putting everything due in the last 3 weeks of classes was a great idea  And with that said  back to work\", \"commentId\": \"34452\",
