"[{\"comment\": \"I will remember this expansion for having the most broken deck in a long time crystal rogue the most boring deck in a long time quest warrior and for the stale rotten stench of pirate warrior overstaying its welcome for yet another season and revealing the absolute patheticness of people playing it to get high rank at the same time thousands of people put Pirate Warrior on bot and come back to collect their rank 1 legend a few days later  What a suckful ladder experience  grind a broken ladder deck or get rofflestomped by the millions of netdeckers playing their broken cancer  Meanwhile Blizzard apologists defend this shit  because theyve climbed okay grinding murlocadin or pirate or midrange hunter  I just feel sorry for people who think the meta is good because they have the sort of psyche that they get satisfaction grinding a top tier netdeck  Yawn  Vomit\", \"commentId\": \"37370\", \"commentDate\": \"1494841430\"}, {\"comment\": \"Murloc paladins are all

playing Magic the Gathering back during lorwyn and alara blocks  People who think the standard meta game or the wild meta game or the arena meta game are garbage  will never not have that opinion  No matter what concessions blizzard made short of just bumping every player with that opinion directly into legend  they will still have that opinion  My legitimate question is what the hell do you guys want exactly from blizzard Like ok lets pretend blizzard released twice as many cards to accommodate a demand for a more diverse meta  They could do this  but not without first pushing the issue of the game being play to win  If you have to get more cards  youre gonna be spending a lot more in game or out game currency to stay current with the large and diverse meta  Even a game like Yugioh which tries to keep every set in the game at all times  has to make changes to the rules or ban lists to keep the game from getting pay to win  The overall point I am trying to make is that the meta is more or less fucking fine  needs a little bit of fine tuning  but if you are not happy with a limited number of decks in the meta game I really cant convince you that this is a good thing  Like its hard enough trying to build a deck that does well vs control and aggro  and can trade with midrange and still win consistently  if I had to take into consideration 12 more decks i might have to counter along the way  that would be complete anarchy and drive me insane  I am pretty sure you meta haters just dislike it because you feel like you should be ranked higher and its the metas fault your not  Chances are though if the meta were more diverse you complainers would be ranked even lower  Like youre having trouble with a meta that is pretty much aggro and anti aggro  with like one good control deck in the mix  How do you think you plebs would fair if that list was expanded to involve 37 decks spanning several different archetypes and involving alternative win conditions Yeah youd be lost for days trying to find your own dicks  Just saying get off your high horse and play the game\", \"commentId\": \"37372\", \"commentDate\": \"1494842965\"}, {\"comment\": \"fuck mages and

over and over  Oh a quest rogue  look here a murloc paladin  oh and a quest warrior  wait whats this  an aggro druid wow  Worst thing is  all these decks always run 95 identical lists  It feels like you are playing against the same 4 people over and over  Any decks that tries to be innovative gets completely shut down by these Tier1 decks due to polarization of the games card design and the only real place you will ever find innovative decks are at legend rank because laddering with subtier 1 decks is neigh impossible   All these unnecessary nerfs specifically  Ironbeak Owl  Keeper of the Grove Molten Giant  Execute  Blade Flurry  Leper Gnome  Knife Juggler  Arcane Golem  Abusive Sergeant  Azure Drake Ancient of Lore have completely killed all variation and options in the meta games  Everything has become overly polarized and the situation for F2P Im P2P but I understand whats going on has never been this awful before  Bring back the variation we had back in 2015  we had everything from classic leper gnome aggro to ultra grindy mages and priest decks  It was a perfect world and was honestly one of the most F2P friendly times weve ever had Mechs were such a great tribe

{\"comment\": \"I am so sick of people using the phrase fucking MetaGAme and not really understanding what the fuck they are talking about so I am just gonna go ahead and educate any moron who comes across this post and happens to read it  The word meta comes from greek  and means to change  is in the word metamorphosis or meta data  So what metagame means is the way in which the game changes either from rank to rank or week to week  So to put this in perspective the meta game of hearthstone is roughly a breakdown of what decks are being played and which decks they do well against and which decks they struggle against  So the meta game for last week and this week is pretty priest heavy  and probably will eb for awhile  but before that it was taunt warrior and control priest heavy  and before that it was quest heavy across the entirety of the fucking game  So when you are saying the words Blizzard fucked up the metagame  no no they fucking didnt you pleb  the way people are playing the game that blizzard gave us is ruining the meta  They presented us the options and a large group of us decided to hunker down in our deck archetype camps and complain about all the other camps  Stop using the word meta game like it means something profound or nebulous  Its not impressing anyone besides the endless groups of sheep that also think and bleet like you  For all of you using the word right  Disregard this rant   That will be all\", \"commentId\": \"37381\", \"commentDate\": \"1494850300\"}, {\"comment\": \"daniel schwartz Meta is a greek word  Also in the neologism

Im playing my Midrange Paladin   For all the bitching about Midrange paladin  my deck is nothing like the murloc paladin thats out there   For one  theres only two murlocs in it  2xHydrologist   Its a Silverhandbased deck instead  and I love playing it   I run 2xBlessing of Wisdom  thats all you need to know   Anyway  its REALLY good against aggro and Quest Rogue    So Im playing vs Pirate Warrior   Ok  I should win this statistically   The guy gets good early draw but doesnt get axe until around turn 5   I had bad early draw but recovered quickly   Basically  the game went almost exactly to script for Pirate Warrior vs  Midrange Paladin   He took early lead  I gradually cleared his board while healing up  he stalled out on draw  and I took control  he conceded   I got the invite before the concede animation could even play so I knew I had won   Now  I dunno bout yall  but people have been very nice so far in Ungoro   I havent had a single irate high school student use some kind of racial or homophobic slur against me    Until now  Guy said  and Im paraphrasing using much nicer language My goodness  but you have uncommonly good fortune for such an uncouth little whelp Or nice fcking bllshit lucky sht draw you fcking little cntwhore Huh  Its not like I topdecked into my only win condition   He lost a game that  statistically  he should lose most of the time  Anyway   I felt kinda bad for him   I was even going to just say sure  it was luck  to defuse him a little  but of course he unfriended me before I could even type yep  Another big tough man online  talking shit to strangers and running away to cry   Poor kid   If he cant take that shot  hes gonna get chewed up by the real world  But kudos to everybody for being mostly pretty cool in the last month   Seriously
