by Pirate warrior so I tried that and FML I got Renoloc STOP FUCKING PLAYING THE CANCER NETDECKS PEOPLE  the winrates are only typically  55 against the other netdecks  Play your own decks  stop

First game against priest ok  no big deal  I play my deckhand with coined out upgrade  Priest then topdecked doomsayer and killed my deckhand and patches  Ok   a bit tilting but sure  I started getting on the board while starting to realize that hes sitting with no boardclear whatsowever  And as a suprise I was right  the guy had no boardclear for 7 turns  On this turn I had naga corsair and bloodsail cultist on the board  I decided to basically play everything which included bloodsail raider  nzoths first mate and frothing berserker  I traded with every one of his minions leaving my berserker with 8 attack  After that he topdecked Dragonfire Potion  which basically caused me to close the game and turn off my pc in speed of light  Im still so fuckin salty after this fuckin retardation\", \"commentId\": \"33118\", \"commentDate\": \"1488685441\"}, {\"comment\": \"Posting on behalf of my opponent who decided to go afk   Today I crafted shaku and put him in my burgle rogue

and Reno that people are gonna spam for the next days I planned on playing Standard this month and laddering exclusively with Maly Rogue and Freeze Mage to say goodbye to Azure Drake Emperor Thaurissan and Ice Lance but Im already pissed and Ive only completed one quest     I mean cmon Ive been hearing complaints about the huge amount of Jade Druids for the last 3 days  and all I face are Shamans while my Gadgetzan Auctioneer that would have been game winning is nowhere to be found  and people thinking they are special snowflakes just cause theyre playing Kazakus and Darkshire Councilman in the same Deck or stupid Dragon Priests with their OP 5 drop that keeps stealing my cards to kill minions that wouldve otherwise snowballed him just to lose from full health to Malygos
