watched me said that they dont understand how can I be so fucking unlucky  this whole shit is fucking rigged because it shouldnt be fucking possible  The amount of fuckings you can read in this

card Ihate the most Along with Sylvannas  Mind Control costs 10 mana and one card AS A PRIEST CLASS CARD  But they put it for basically free as a trigger on two cards  but at random  WHYYYYYYYY With Dirty Rat  MCTech is now seeing play at high ranks too and its just    so   damn   stupid   holy crap  Granted in ranked by the time you play this combo the game can be over But in arena  mctech  and deathwing  are just absurdly dumb  At least Deathwing is a legendary  In like 5000 arena games Ive been deathwinged like 34 times but MCTeched more times than I can count  Screw that dumpster card\",

worst feeling in the world is losing to a conditional overtuned tech card  I cant count how many times Ive lost to that kirin card in wild that steals a secret while I was playing a control mage  I frequently add the enemy player afterwards and ask why they run that card  and they say to counter secret paladin  They play a shitty card in every nonsecret matchup  that isnt actually good against secret paladin  in hopes to counter it  Funny thing is when I play secret paladin and this card gets played against me I just laugh because they get a nonsynergistic secret and a 43 for 4 mana that doesnt contest the board at all\", \"commentId\": \"30007\", \"commentDate\": \"1482513761\"}, {\"comment\": \"That fuckin piece of shit driving me fuckin crazy 23 13 03 03 FUCKIN LAST 4 ARENA RUNS

it in Brawl lol Seriously delete it  You cant make this card work  ever  The only thing that people will ever do with this card is to design decks where you ingore the other player  try to stall and then just drop it  cycle your deck and set up a win Same thing for Ice Block  Alex  Reno  One of those has to go as well Or just introduce discard  finally  which will put an end to hearthstones long history of stupid hold the combo in my hand until I burst you for 60 deck design Then you can have all those decks if you want  but you always risk losing to discard  Sorry sad day for you  thats the risk of playing a combo deck  whereas right now  there is zero risk  you just need to get lucky enough to survive  The only counter to combo is kill you fast  Shit\", \"commentId\": \"30017\",
