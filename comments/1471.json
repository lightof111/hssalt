dont play aggro decks I find Reno is mostly a problem against midrange What midrange decks exist right nowLike   shaman Is that even midrangeI like playing midrange mage or rogue with sweet burgle and

used to have cards like Flamestrike  Antique Healbot and Sludge Belcher  Cards that slow the other player down  not just LEL I DROO MAH KARD I WINZIt just pushes the importance of lucky draws to a new
