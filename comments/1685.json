\"commentDate\": \"1492187632\"}, {\"comment\": \"This game is turning into a bigger joke with each game I play  My last 4 games of ranked play rank 10 btw Game 1 I play with my Exodia Magedeck against an ElementalShaman  I get 4 Ice Blocks  but I cant complete my wombocombo because 2 of my 5 combocards are in the last 4 cards of my deck 1 Sorcerers Apprentice and 1 Molten Reflection  I guess I was just unlucky   Game 2 I play with my Hemet Combo Hunterdeck I know its a shit memedeck  but still  and I play against a Rogue that goes second  On turn 1 he plays his Backstab on one of my minions  Coin  Counterfeit Coin into Edwin van Cleef 88  GG  and I guess my opponent got a bit lucky   Game 3 Still playing with my HCHdeck and I play against a druid  I was hoping it was a QuestDruiddeck so Id have a chance  but it was an aggro druid  He goes first and plays his Enchanted Raven  I play my Fiery Bat  He uses his hero power to kill it on turn 2  and the 1damage from the deathrattle goes to his face and not his minion  On my second turn  I play my second Fiery Bat and my Alleycat  He uses his hero power on my Fiery Bat on turn 3  and again the 1damage from its deathrattle goes to his face and again not his minion  He then uses his Innervate to play his Vicious Fledgling  and I cant do anything to remove that  so I play my Scavenging Hyena and trade in my Alleycat into his Enchanted Raven  He then plays his Bloodsail Corsair on turn 4 to trade his Patches into my Jeweled Macaw that I played the previous turn  and he uses his second Innervate to play his Bittertide Hydra  The next turn  I can only trade my Scavenging Hyena into his Vicious Fledgling to prevent him from gaining Windfury when itll probably attack my face  and nothing much else  He goes face  and the next turn I cant play anything to prevent him from hitting lethal the next turn  so I concede  Guess I just got unlucky with him getting 2 Innervates in his first 67 cards  and that my Fiery Bats deathrattles both hit his face   Game 4 Im still playing with my HCHdeck  and this time I face a TauntWarrior  This game went on a little longer than the previous one  but long story short On turn 7  8 or 9 dont remember exactly  I had completed my quest and my opponent still needed to play 2 more tauntminions to complete his quest  and I had played my Queen Carnassa  My board is pretty wide  so I figured hed probably play one of his Brawls that turn  I have 2 cards in hand an Alleycat or a Jeweled Macaw  and an Tundra Rhino  He plays his Dirty Rat  and gets my second Tundra Rhino to the board  and then plays his Brawl  Out of all 7 minions on board  his sole minion his Dirty Rat survives  I guess I again got unlucky   This shit is just not funny anymore  if you get so unlucky all the time or if your opponent get so incredibly lucky all the time  Of course its cool that theres a bigger diversity in Rankeddecks in this meta than the previous one because more decks are viable on the Ladder right now  but its such a shame that most decks are so heavily dependent on RNG e g  drawing exactly the right cards at the right time like my Rogue and Druid opponents did above  or getting really lucky with Brawl  In my opinion  RNG is bad for the game  because it takes away a lot of skill  Id much rather play a game that requires a bit more skill  than play this currently RNGfest of a meta right now  And ive been playing Hearthstone for a while now  so Ive seen some metas that were pretty RNGbased like the Yoggmeta after the WOTOGexpansion  but this meta is just ridiculous and especially not fun or enjoyable in contrast with the Yoggmeta  that was also a big RNGfest  but that was actually a lot of fun to play although it didnt require much skill  I would even nearly go as far to say that the previous meta of MSG that was heavily infested with Pirate Warriors  Renodecks and Jade DruidsShamans and Dragon Priests required much more skill  and most importantly was a lot more fun and enjoyable  than the current meta  And to think that we thought the meta of MSG couldnt get any worse   P S  Game 5 Exodia mage vs AggroMidrangeHunter Turn 5 I play my Frost Nova  Doomsayer on his board 3 minions  and I have a Loot Hoarder in case he tries to Deadly Shot my Doomsayer  His turn 6 Plays Deadly Shot and it hits my Doomsayer  This games RNG shits on me so hard  Or apparently my opponent was reaaaally skilled    LUL\", \"commentId\": \"35360\", \"commentDate\": \"1492188219\"}, {\"comment\": \"Can we please go back to the meta where Hunter didnt exist  It was way better when you didnt have to deal with the abomination that is turn 6 Savannah Highmane especially after they curved perfectly from 1 to 5     Im also starting to hate Tundra Rhino actually Im starting to hate Charge as a mechanic    Ive never really been a fan of it but this expansion its making me wish it never existed    All Quest Rogue does is throwing the same stupid 1 mana Charge minion at your face like 5 times in a turn Hunters spam that damn Tundra Rhino and if that wasnt annoying enough people are playing damn Silence Priest    Theres nothing that pisses me off more than losing to Priest    Thats probably cause I used to bully them with FreezeMiracleHandlock and now those arent free wins anymore     Id even be ok Silence Priest but I just cant stand that retarded card that is Inner Fire     Can we get that into the HOF If I have to lose Ice Lance cause it enables burst combos than that has to go as well      End of the rant now you can start the crusade in defense of Silence Priest\", \"commentId\": \"35361\", \"commentDate\": \"1492188924\"}, {\"comment\": \"so fun and interactive   have yet to see one of these fuckers finish quest after turn 6\",

his 9  I had a board capable of dealing well over 9 and he had 1 card in his hand that was a freeze trapd Infested Wolf  He had 18 cards left in his deck and of course  top decked a kill command  Next game was against an Elemental shaman  Game wasnt exactly close  but I had a way to definitely seal the game  Basically a full board on my side about to contest his 25 health while he had none and a 2 card hand  He devolved my entire board and a mjority of the minions turn into 1 health Twilight Drake  really which he quickly maelstrom portals  One of my guys turn into a Crystalline Oracle which gave me a Blazecaller  Yes I have a Kalimos in my hand from Elise  I can heal for 12 and seal the game again  But wait  his devolve turned one of my guys into a Alarmobot  What are the chances though Yep  Blazecaller gets Alarmotrond and I lose the game a few turns later\", \"commentId\": \"35366\", \"commentDate\": \"1492193286\"}, {\"comment\": \"Or just a bot\", \"commentId\": \"35367\",
