and I played against a mill rogue  Bad matchup for him  Im laddering hunter  So he tries to mill me but that only helps me get threats out faster  Also he started milling way too early  So not only was he a mill rogue at rank 7  he was a bad mill rogue at rank 7   But this it he salt thread so  um  fuck zoolocks and renolocks for being a bad matchup for me Jerks\", \"commentId\": \"28469\",

posting this to be salty about the salt thread  If you people are losing to bad RNG as consistently as you say you are  then either 1  youre just super unlucky and probably shouldnt be playing a card game  or 2  you win some games  and you lose some games  and youre just salty you didnt win all of them  As CRAZY as it sounds  when playing enough games  you will have a  5 WL ratio  If youre losing as many games to RNG and MidRange Shaman as say our good friend SchruteBucks and many other frequent posters are saying  then Im sorry  but you simply arent a lucky person  But I highly doubt thats the case  If you are meeting that many midrange shamans  and losing to them all the time  youre doing something wrong  By math  you should be able to beat midrange shaman AT LEAST 40 of the time  People seem to forget that the entire premise of hearthstone is based off RNG  down to its most basal mechanic Card draw  If a Midrange shaman draws terribly  he loses BECAUSE of bad RNG  Heshe didnt get their necessary cards early enough  If you draw poorly  and the mid range shaman draws like a god  the Shaman wins most of the time  However  if Im playing my Ogres Champion OTK warrior deck  and I draw amazingly well AND win the 5050 to hit face with charge  then I win  No matter how good you say you are  or how many cancer decks you meet on ladder  you should be able to beat these decks and not lose to terrible RNG a reasonable amount of the time  and if you are  then its some Ben Brode Illuminati stuff going on with you\", \"commentId\": \"28471\", \"commentDate\": \"1480308606\"},
