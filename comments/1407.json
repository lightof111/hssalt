is to get the fuckin twisting neither or has it in which he top decked  after that he used fkign Emperor tharussian and after that Jaraxxus with the discount which then i couldnt anything because guess what i didnt had the burst so i lost the game  Oh wait theres more  went up agaisnt a priest and he stole my fking Jaraxxus from fking Dragon Operator  And many many more  today in the morning i was rank 8 one win away from rank 7 with winstreak and had a dc  but i didnt quit  so i kept playing but after that i lost to a fking pirate warrior again one win away  so tryed once more but failed due to a fking Ice Block from a cabalist tome  after that  the salt levels were soo insane that i forgot the amount of crazy rng shit fiesta this game has  So in the beggining  in the morning i was
