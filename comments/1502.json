"[{\"comment\": \"Im beginning to actually be deterred by hearthstone somewhat  all these pirate warriors making ladder and even causal a choir of note it is quite frustrating when youre trying to play a deck that requires a bit of time to execute the necessary combo or sequence to actually have the deck perform its job and turn 4  the pirate warrior got the perfect curve and youre down to 10 or less health  It takes away that skill and thinkingahead that can take place in the game  while your opponent is just top decking everything  worse than face hunters and aggro shamans  My two cents  say that i have no skill or cant play  thats your own deep seated issues that you possess and I do hope you have a chance to remedy your scarring mother issues  that motivates one to play such an inbred deck to get that quickfix selfapproval  Thank You\", \"commentId\": \"31540\", \"commentDate\": \"1485509964\"}, {\"comment\": \"I cant play ranked game anymore because I hate this meta so much  Its just the current power level of the cards getting stronger every expansion  when Cthun released  I thought it would be one of the strongest card  apparently we got fast spawning giant golems from Jade idol and every op card at early turns  This game is becoming rock paper and scissor now  fuck pirates  jade golems and dirty rats  Im so fed up that I want to return back in the old time where I got hit in the face around 15 damage by Flamewaker  Geez  I remembered my complaint about this one in this thread and I thought nothing get worse than that card next expansion  apparently I was wrong Im simultaneously enjoying and suffering from this game   Thanks Ben Brode\", \"commentId\": \"31541\", \"commentDate\": \"1485510316\"}, {\"comment\": \"I dont know why i thought that legend ranks

what are they trying to achieve top 100 when 3 days before the end of the season in top 5000 give me break  god damnit  even wild is more relaxed  between the 100 pirate warriors theres at least 15
