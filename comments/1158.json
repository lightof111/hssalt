netdeck debate Im relaxing  doing some dailies in casual with a standard handlock list Ive cobbled together hint its bad  I lose to a Cthun priest in a relatively close MU  and I get a friend request afterwards  to be told Idiot  who plays handlock what is out of the meta  If I wanted to play good decks  then Id not go to casual  surely The whole concept of casual seems to be lost on some people  Im not salty but its relevant to the salt of others here  I can understand wanting to practise in a less aggressive and pressured environment when youre trying a new deck you want to be able to see what works and what fails  and get a feeling for the deck  But that shouldnt take more than a few games  max  Blithering idiots  Not every deck is good enough for Ladder  Being able to play jank like prophet velen combo priest or reincarnate shaman  for example  is an integral part of casual to me\", \"commentId\": \"24217\", \"commentDate\": \"1471306681\"}, {\"comment\": \"I need an auto concede
