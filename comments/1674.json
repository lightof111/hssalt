came out Ill ONLY play tier 1 decks  Im making foolish mistakes by going back to my old ways of trying new things and having fun   Quest Rogue  Im coming  I want to win as mindlessly win as possible  When its time to flip coins  I want heads on both sides  and I can want to pick heads   Tried of having to try  I want to just vomit cards from my hand on curve and only count to 5   I honestly wish they would look at the game with a less aggro approach  Everything is fast  now  die  fast  play cards ASAP  die  what is turn 6 Die  youre not dying fast enough  fast fast fast   Like I understand the appeal  Very short attention spans  struggle when being forced to count with 2 digits  Any sort of thought process  But make it fun  This is like blind folding boxers  someone will get knocked

streak and I was 1 game away from hitting rank 6 with elemental paladin  But then I get completely rekt  First game I was plying against a pirate warrior with a perfect curve and he played a frothing beserker that I couldnt answer and he won the game off of that one card  Like wtf it is the most op 3 drop in the game and win games by itself so easily  Next game im up against a jade druid and he also has a great curve  I played out my dirty rat and i pull out his Dark Arakoa and after looking at everything he did  in the following turns it was best out of like 5 minions in his hand which were all great  targets for dirty rat like jade spirit and the new druid 2 drop that gives you a 5 attack card  He soon plays said two drop twice and on his second one he gets Aya Blackpaw as JADE druidand im pretty sure it is the best minion he couldve gotten  even more then 4 mana 77 since it was a 6 drop he needed and it gave like 1412 worth of stats  I lost this game  Up next is a hunter who got a pretty good curve but annialated me by getting posionus with razorma onto his cat 1 drop and winning off of that  Finally I face a quest rogue who completed his quest on turn  3 and preped it out the next turn  Now im stuck at 0 stars rank 7 and still kinda salty\", \"commentId\": \"35143\", \"commentDate\": \"1491934363\"}]"
