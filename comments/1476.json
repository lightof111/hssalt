cancerous  I say i prefer losing a game where i at least got to play the deck i crafted and have fun with  than lose a game where i die before playing more than 4 cards of my deck\", \"commentId\":

instead of killing a murloc recruit  wich  combined with finja  resulted in me being unable to kill the incoming massive board  while if I killed the recruit I could have killed a Murloc Warleader and wiped the board with an empowered Fan of Knives  Then in a custom renolock vs typical renolock I forgot my win conditionw as the leeroy combo  so I played thaurissan without discounting a single piece of it  That combined with RNG severely screwing me like  I play Doomsayer with a bazillion of irrelevant minions in hand  Opponent plays Dirty Rat  summons my Rag  Damn it  its already being hard as shit to rank up lately  I had no better idea than make it even harder runing the first two winstreaks I had in a week\", \"commentId\": \"30980\", \"commentDate\": \"1484354894\"}, {\"comment\":

closed beta yet  but you can register for it and be able to play like in 2 weeks  and it soon goes open beta  Yes  this Witcher gwent  where you are unable to mindlessy go face  and vominitng your hand on the board wont win you the game  because youll be fucked over in next 2 turns  YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO THINK TO WIN ANY GAME  UNBELIEVABLE  And you accumulate gold like 34 times faster than in HS  cards cost half when crafting F2P is actually a thing  you neednt to spend ages in game to get decent collection and equivalent of golden cards premium cards is infinitely better made and animated than HS golden cards MAYBE if blizz wont get money  they will consider doing anything about the game I think letting meta of 5 classes and 3 archetypes aggro  reno and dragon staying in any game mode longer than 3 weeks is blantly laziness and incompetence  Stop paying people that are ignoring you  and gwent has way better soundtrack and multiple  awesome battlecries\", \"commentId\": \"30982\",

kinds of control decks that are currently fighting the aggro shamans and pirate warriors will be gone  No more Reno  Brann  Demonwrath  Dark Peddler  Imp Gang Boss  low cost dragons  Excavated Evil  Entomb not like Im gonna really miss that one  dragon synergy  Torch  Ethereal Conjurer  Elise  Flamewaker not like Im gonna miss that    Meanwhile  pirate warrior only loses optional Argent Horserider and Finley  Jade druid only loses Living Roots  Shaman as far as I know loses Trogg  Totem Golem and optional Ancestral Knowledge  Whos gonna stop the lunatic jade druid and face rushers specially warrior then I really hope they get their shit together and have a set ready to keep something close to balance  otherwise control decks will be more than dead except possible kazakus

   I never thought it would happen but I seem to have found a card that pisses me off more than Kezan Mystic     They should change this crap battlecry to Discover the one copy of Sylvanas Windrunner contained into your opponents Deck    I just had to deal with my Sylvanas 3 times all cause of this fucking retarded shit minion     Why why does this crap need to be worded like that Cant it be just like Thoughtsteal No of course it cant    It needs to be a Dragon so that it can be discovered several times cause Im starting to think the sole purpose of Netherspite Historian is dishing out more copies of this thing just to piss me off    and it needs to have 6 HP so that a single AOE doesnt do shit against it and while were at it why not letting poor Anduin take a look at my Deck I mean hes so sad cause his stupid cards cant deal with my Twilight Drake that he needs some overpowered shit to steal my cards to get rid of it     I love Dragons BRM is my favourite adventure just cause it released them  but now everytime I hear Secret Agent Coming Through I wish I could grab my stupid Priest opponent  create a solid copy of that idiotic minion and make him swallow it     Just use your fucking damn cards Whenever I see a Priest with Handlock I want to know that Lord Jaraxxus and Twilight Drake card will utterly destroy them not that some shitty fucking broken OP minion can turn the whole MU around     So just fuck you cardDrakonid Operative I hope you suffer the same fate of YataGarasu\", \"commentId\": \"30993\", \"commentDate\": \"1484393262\"}, {\"comment\": \"For real U must
