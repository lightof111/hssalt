them  If you are for some reason a Control Warrior or Aggro deck  you obviously will have not big problems against a freeze mage  If you are lets say a more midrangy deck that has a bit of everything  you save any weopon for a dead turn aka that board nova turn and hit them in the face to not let up on them  You never use a damage spell that can be directed to the face on their minions and will use those if your board is in a frost state instead to again keep pressure on them  An earlie start with minions is key since they wont do much damage later in the game anymore  If you run deathrattles  good on you  The best deathrattle minions have 1 or 2 health before turn 6  Your life total against a freeze Mage does basically not matter until Alex comes down  So minion chip damage from them is basically meaningless  Let them trade with you  they need those card draws anyway  Freeze Mages are weak to the following Weapons  Charged minions  minions with deathrattle and low health  silence  minions that heal you  minions that deal damage without attacking  direct damage spells  minions that counters secrets  armor  The new Time Warp Mage is in its current state even weaker than freeze mage of old  so you should be fine against them\", \"commentId\": \"35460\", \"commentDate\": \"1492358816\"}, {\"comment\": \"Well I had everything you say and still couldnt beat one  Turn 2 Doomsayer wipes my board since again I didnt spend 1600 dust on a Stonetusk Boar so I was off that 1 crucial point of damage to be able to kill it  Then turn 3 sets up the first Ice block and emotes Well Played because he knows he cant lose anymore  Meanwile I try to put as much pressure on the board as possible with Fiery War Axe  Bloodsail Raider  Frostbolt kills it  plays the 2 Mana Deathrattle Draw a Frost Nova guy  Turn 5 Frost Nova Doomsayer  Turn 6 Blizzard  Turn 7 Im completely out of minions since Warrior doesnt have card draw  So now he has all the time in the world to draw more Ice Blocks  Ice Barriers  Frost Novas  Meanwhile I punch him for 6 every turn using an upgraded Arcanite Reaper but that doesnt even go through the Ice Barrier  He just sits there  masturbating furiosly as he enjoys his free win  Ok that last bit may be exaggerated but maybe not  Late game looks always like this Hit face proc the iceblock  pass since I cant do anything else  renew my weapon  He replays an Ice Block  sets up his combos and whistles happily while doing so  My turn  I proc the block again and pass since thats the only thing I can do  Rinse and repeat until he pulls of his combo and wins\", \"commentId\": \"35461\", \"commentDate\": \"1492360350\"}, {\"comment\": \"This fucking retarded shit is unbearable  Ladder is full of double digit iq players who

The thing is  I simply cant reach rank 10  no matter how hard I try  My decks are quite solid  I suppose  My collection seems to be in good shape  and Ive been playing this game pretty much ever since Blackrock Mountain came out  Im facing so many toptier decks at those 1510 ranks  that its unbelievable  Taunt warriors with copypasted decks from various sites  not to mention all those damn quest rogues and mages just swarming the current meta and taking all the fun away  I mean  they probably have lots of it  but playing against those decks is a nightmare for me  Pirate warrior was actually better to play against  cause he would finish you quickly and you could just keep going on ladder  even winning against them sometimes  but now I feel that the games tend to be no more than ridiculously long agony  My best decks are currently your typical Elemele shaman and Miracle Rogue very similar to Eloises but without Patches and with few other things changed  Do you guys suggest anything I could relly use some help \", \"commentId\": \"35466\", \"commentDate\": \"1492364063\"}, {\"comment\": \"arena is  nightmare \", \"commentId\": \"35467\", \"commentDate\": \"1492364395\"},
