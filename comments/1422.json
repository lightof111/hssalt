people would just abuse Anyfin by playing chargers Really That was too difficult to understand  that you just made a 30 free burst card RIGHT AFTER having to nerf Force of Nature  a card that requires ANOTHER card to deal half the damage of anyfinHow many times are they going to keep making the same mistakesDo they just want every game to end at most on turn 10\", \"commentId\": \"29811\",

decks is to copy whatever easy legend fast climb decks are featuring on the front page of sites like this  I do understand and feel sorry for them  I also understand that Hearthstone is full of insecure  spottyfaced virgins  who need cheap thrills from emotes used to mock their opponent  And I totally get that a lot of people are so retarded that the second something doesnt go right in their netdeck vomit they feel the need to sulk or think by burning rope  When 90 of the player base are desperate little children  I guess you can expect a lot of sulking and tryhard delaying tactics  What I dont get is why we cant have an auto squelch option to silence the sad little fuckers for an entire season  and I dont understand why there cant be some sort of decent health penalty that punishes roping\", \"commentId\": \"29812\", \"commentDate\": \"1482199196\"}, {\"comment\": \"It was so funny to watch kripp in arena last night lol He clearly hates the game now  Hopefully the devs finally
