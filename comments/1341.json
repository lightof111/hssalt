we do lose to things beyond our control  but chances are you made a mistake earlier in the game  I see you post on here so much that Im sure youre tilting pretty hard  Now that Im not tilting any more and I lost my last few games  Im in a better head space  What you need to do is figure out what mistake you made that allowed that to happen  It may seem like blind luck  but a lot of the game is based on having some idea of what your opponent might play  If Im playing Hunter and Im playing against a druid  and I have a freezing trap in my starting hand  Im going to keep that freezing trap until later in the game when he plays arcane giant  That kind of thing\", \"commentId\": \"28138\", \"commentDate\": \"1479689884\"}]"
