is to spend money and build a strong control deck if all you have to do is netdeck some cheap smroc or Zoo deck that can win 10 games per hour  Its fucking stupid and predictable  Gee  Huntard has 3

aint selling my soul to play zoo or shaman because its boring as shit and just playing warlock today for the 60 quest warlockshaman quest of course made me physically ill  Yesterday I said fuck it and made the most degenerate shit I could think of  Now Im switching between playing patron hunter and dragon hunter and all of a sudden I have a positive winratio but more importantly fun again  Just wow  Except     meeting the same decks over and over and over again when you know exactly the card and even the fucking voice acting thats gonna come next at any given time in any given match is so   fucking   boring   Foudn myself mouthing the words of the voice overs as they happened not even looking at the screen  I might have to turn the sound off now because Im tempted to gouge my fucking eyes out everytime I hear the imptaunt combo on turn 1 again or the freaking hurr durr did you bring some fiiiish followed by huahuhauh or Fshshhhhh for obligatory free 34 or flametongue totem  Standard ladder feels like being stuck in  limbo  its so freaking boring  Might just play the game for casual card collectingarena and making friends  its like 1000 times more enjoyable than playing the predictable freak show that is ladder  Unfortunately its so hard to meet new people because why would they add you when 99 of the time its gonna be an asshole wanting to flame them  Great fucking

Yogg is so completely fair and balanced it hurts  the body sucks for its cost and the times you win a game you werent going to are so minimal its not relevant  and if you wanna claim that the

see your puny Knife Juggler do that There is not a single card that can turn games around like Yogg does and yes you can Pyroblast your own face and the randomness means the card can be subpar but the
