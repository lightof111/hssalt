to fix  but because they simply dont care  If have seen many things  but this is the new over the top threatment  And again I do not care if there are work arrounds from the community  because its not like it hinders my gaming experience  its about a principle and if a company needs now half a year for a bug that can be fixed in one weekend  than they leave me no other choice  This isnt only
