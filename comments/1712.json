deck construction  Started with Reno which I hate the concept but was tolerable in a sense   Then discover cards rampant  where Discover means your about to possibly get a card that will in all seriousness win you a game  based 100 off rng   But now Ive seen it all with these questsadapt concepts  Dislike adapt due to high impact of the rng  but the quests have produced some nonsense decks  and I have seen some nonsense throughout my years  but some of these decks even outside of quests allow you to have little to no decision making capability or game strategy but if you just aim to complete your quest and get good draw  u can win  So much room for error and bad plays without punishment  Here are my top 2 concepts that are at the very least powerful without needing any gamesense  1  Quest rogue   Im sorry  but this deck if it draws half decent just floods the board with 1 mana 55s many with taunt or divine shield early on  No decision making  no strategy  just get your return to hand cards early and you now have a 95 chance to win  2  Agro druids  Remind me of old aggro pallets  but at least when pallets blew their hand u knew if u cleared it while keeping your card count low  you win  Druids can be out of cards  you blow all resources to successfully defend against it  they then topdeck living mana and they effectively just drew 45 22s and played them all on 1 turn  Broken  Im doing ok given I play freeze mage  but there is just so much cancerous bullshit concepts being throw at this game  Playing competitive games is more fun than winning  butso many decks with proper card draw dont just put you at a disadvantage  which is fine if they draw good and u draw bad  but their good draw leads to a near guarantee victory  REGARDLESS of how you draw  even if you picked which cards u started and drew with  you can still get hammered without even having a chance to stop it  please get back to interesting cards blizzard that dont rely on such scrub and random
