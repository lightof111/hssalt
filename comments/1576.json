seriously  fuck it   Today for 2 hours straight its been Pirate Warrior and fucking Jade Druid   In wild   And wild casual   Im fucking done   Whoever thought Jade decks would be a good idea must have been high as fuck   And I get these players after worthy opponent appears on the wheel   Worthy opponent huh  Bullshit   Decks are made to be piloted now   You dont play the game   You watch it   You move your mouse pointer  plop a card and thats it   No interaction whatsoever   And the worst part is the bad players NEVER get punished for mistakes   They ruined what could have been a great game by dumbing down the player base not the players fault btwits the card design by making the game so easy to play you dont need any skill whatsoever   You just hope RNGesus is on your side   I miss the days when you actually had to think before making a decision  Just waiting for Gwent to finish downloading so I can start playing that   Been watching Noxious stream it and it looks a lot more appealing  Thanks for ruining  the game\", \"commentId\": \"33104\", \"commentDate\": \"1488651504\"}, {\"comment\": \"Hope Brodes bosses read this thread so they get an idea of how badly the design team have ruined a once playable game  All the potential deckbuilding fun has gone because 90 of the player base just pick a top level netdeck without thought  and because of the poor game design it will be overpowered and not punish misplays or encourage strategy  The Reno decks all play themselves  removal on curve into Reno into bran kafukus into some big drops  The dragon decks play themselves  early buff dragons or historians into  Drakonid  The only decision with Shaman is how late to play the lightning storm  If Jade Druid gets early removal the endgame is unbeatable  Its Rock Paper Scissors with some big swing cards that decide games depending on whether or not  they are drawn  Every expansion brings some DELIBERATELY unbalanced cards to give the meta decks an unfair edge  This creates pressure for people to buy packs from the latest expansion  All Blizzards bullshit about monitoring things while we suffered pirate decks playing STB was just their way of delaying the nerf to maximise sales of the packs  Its a gigantic con  There is no way you are building a collection of playable cards with long term utility  pay Blizzard their quarterly blood money to buy packs to play the current cancer decks or get shit on by the newbies playing decks screaming for a nerf who havent seen through the con yet  Add to that no penalty whatsoever for abusing the turn timer by playing to rope  no autosquelch option to disable the 10 year olds spamming their bullshit  its easy to forget  and you end up with a game that was once so good but is now a steaming pile of shit\",

 I am 1 card away from a 30 druid cards quest completed  so I decided to give the brawl another shot  Ok  first matches I play as Kazakus  no big deal  Its a bit annoying  but well  how could that ruin my mood Kazakus vs Aya Opponent gets better early game basically because I have not much like a curve  I try to stabilize my turn 4 vs a Lotus Illusionist with a Hired Gun and a Blowgill Sniper waiting in hand  Then opponents turn 5 11 Jade Golem  then Patches the Pirate    wich pulls another Patches the Pirate    wich pulls another Patches the Pirate  For some reason  opponent still attacked the taunt with the 35 instead of sacrificing those tokens to get the 6drop  but still I was in an awkward position  But well  I played Raza the Chained and so I can juggle a bit with potions to keep opponent at bay  Then opponent reaches turn 10  Kun the Forgotten King into Kun the Forgotten King into some drops  However  after lots of struggles due in part to me being unable to draw any of the big AoEs  I still can slowly get over that and turn the game in my favor  At this time it would be important to notice how poor a player that was  as it kept misplaying for a long time before and after these two kuns  with fails such as swapping a damaged jade golem so I could steal it with Potion of Madness or not triggering Jade Shuriken combo  I was starting to get opponent to lethal range  Had board advantage and health advantage  Opponent plays 3rd Kun the Forgotten King into the rest of its hand  An unfortunate setback  but not enough  I can get over that too and push more  I finally make it reach Felfire Potion range  Of course I dont draw it  but some turns after I finally got the Aya in a situation where I have enough damage on board to finish this even after trades  But what does opponent topdecks 4th Kun the Forgotten King Gets 10 Armor  so I can no longer beat it unless Felfire Potion finally gets drawn from free hero power  Wich doesnt  3 Patches  4 Kuns  and still a not fucked up curve and good topdecks every single time    how many dicks you sucked for that SERIOUSLY  HOW MANY   Then just to add insult to injury  next 3 matches are Aya vs Aya  and my opponent concedes at turn 5 at best  before I cant even play that druid card that would get my quest done after getting awful plays such as turn 2 raw Jade Shuriken to my 30 Health face  WHAT THE FUCK HAS ALL THAT SHIT BEEN\", \"commentId\": \"33114\", \"commentDate\": \"1488675388\"}]"
