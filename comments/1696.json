Am I the only one who thinks Blizzard is becoming so f      greedy They took out more than 200 cards from my standard collection and game me THREE PACKS and a golden trash Also  they said they would make adventurous expansions  giving us packs and rewards  to compensate the lack of Adventures guaranteed cards and nothing has happened for UnGoro    Really  they are one step to become the next Wizards of the Coast   Before you ask what I was expecting  I think they could give us the Quests without the option of disenchanting them\", \"commentId\": \"35581\", \"commentDate\":

anwsers in my hand other then a lonesome Pyromancer  I played Elise earlier and opened a pack that contained Tortollan Primelist  8 mana  53 discover a random spell on random targets and you could probably guess it  there was Equality to save the day  So his minions went to 1  I played my Pyromancer and activited it with Forbidden healing which cleared his entire board   From there on it was smooth sailing as he was running out of steam  But one of the most unexpected memorable turn arounds for me personally\", \"commentId\": \"35587\", \"commentDate\": \"1492544855\"}, {\"comment\": \"I think that Quest Rogue is too powerful too  but I dont think that the Quest is the problem  I think Shadowstep is the true culprit that enables the deck to be as powerful as it is  They either need to nerf it to 1 mana or just make its effect Return a friendly minion to your hand  That would slow down the deck significantly\", \"commentId\": \"35588\", \"commentDate\": \"1492545500\"},

when  half the time you face aggro netdecks and the other half are broken mechanic netdecks  Once in a blue moon do you see something creative  and never do you really ever see somebody actually friend request just to talk about decks and what not always a bitch fit  I thought ungoro was gonna be a game changer  a sweet introduction to better gameplay  it was going to be the shit  well now look at it  two overplayed quest decks in wild Quest Rogue  Pirate Warrior  2 broken quest decks Quest Rogue  Quest Mage  2 oldie decks that have yet to find those counter effects that blizzard keeps saying exists Secret Paladin  Freeze Mage  So I wonder when do we actually get to have fun  Casual is filled with the netdecks  rank is filled with netdecks  tavernbrawl is filled with the netdecks  and arena is well lol arena  The meta is so oppressive and yes it is an online game so there is manipulation of card draw  sigh well atleast microsoft hasnt butchered the halo series   am right hahaha yeah that last line was sarcasm   fuck you microsoft   praise bungie   Oh and lets not mention the fact that in the hearthpwn general forums the salt thread is almost 1 000 times larger than any other
