"[{\"comment\": \"Ive said it once  Ill say it again  I  FUCKING  HATE  GAME  ANIMATIONS  This shit just cost me a game  because I was forced to watch an hour long animation of a quest completion and therefore couldnt play another card this turn  The animation Ive seen at least 200 times by now GAAAAAAAH And the little tune that plays during it  sounded like TADAAAAAM YOURE FUCKED\",

good counter  and match you up with it If thats the case just make some none meta changes so it cant determine what youre playing  Feel free to believe what you want  and this is the salt thread after all  but I think its in your best interest to not try to blame external factors for what can be simply dismissed as bad luck\", \"commentId\": \"38046\", \"commentDate\": \"1495787342\"},

again confirmation bias  The be all and all awsner everyone goes to on this topic   Look if I play a deck that has burn  most of my opponents will be mage with iceblock so I cant OTK them  You can call it bad luck all you want  but if it becomes statisticly trackable  constant bad AND GOOD luck then something is fishy  Because playing the algorithm works both ways  play midrange agro priest  add 1 mindblast  the game thinks youre burn priest so it matches you with iceblock mages a lot  and boom free wins  Then ofcourse when you go above the 50 winrate to much youll eventually start losing a bunch to get back to 50 winrate  Blizz wants everyone to have fun  so that more people buy packs  If it was a true random system a lot of people would have less fun because their winrate wouldnt be around 50 but a lot lower   If youve ever played paper MTG a bunch youll see the bullshit in hearthstone matchmaking right away\", \"commentId\": \"38048\", \"commentDate\": \"1495789594\"},

system Ive read  Ive known for a long time that its not truly random and now Im convinced  Not only do I see it with myself  but when I watch streamers  I watch guys like Reynad and he will tech in something to deal with what he is facing over and over again  After the change  he will go hours without seeing that deck again  One saving grace for me though is that the algorithm seems to think that quest rogue is a good matchup for freeze mage  I started playing after work last night and my first 5 matches were ALL quest rogues  I beat them all extremely easily  This game really brings out the worst in me though unlike any game ever and Ive been playing computer games since C64  I despise quest rogue players so much that all the guys I played last night I let the rope burn every turn
