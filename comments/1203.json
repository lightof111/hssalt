\"commentDate\": \"1472760195\"}, {\"comment\": \"Please explain why people netdecking is a problem It simply forces all decks into a state of artificial evolution  The weak decks will be weeded out and people who dont simply netdeck will be forced to up their game  their decks will get better  and they will get better  Sure  in casual its more upsetting  but those people have a right to play those decks  and many of the decks you might call netdecking can still be homebrews  Weather people go online or not  their token druid decks will turn out similar  With such a small pool of cards  the meta does tend to converge  I feel like the real  true casual mode is a friendly challenge  You just get to chat and play with no repercussion to your rank or increase of gold at all  If you want a meta isolated from netdecks  Id suggest perhaps setting up a thread of people whod like really casual game and set up certain deck restriction every week or something  For example  no using cthun  or no goddamned motherfucking face shamans  on the topic of whats wrong with standard though  I feel like there should still be a skill level matching system   It isnt fun for anyone when some guy who just started play faces legend tier cthun druid or something\", \"commentId\": \"25188\", \"commentDate\": \"1472764503\"}, {\"comment\": \"This game is a shit  pure luck no more  and Blizz  Im

\"commentDate\": \"1472766864\"}, {\"comment\": \"I kinda have the same view  but some people are just too self centered to admit that theyre bad at creating decks so instead of trying to become better at it they just bash whoever netdecks because thats no skill but I also love getting into a skype call with a friend from time to time to just sit down and decide what we are gonna create  like last month when silverware golem came out we spent a good 3 hours making a discard lock good enough to hit rank 10 and it was a lot more fun than just netdecking and getting to rank 5 in the season and leave rankedin the end people just need to relaxbecause compared to other games hearthstone is still pretty young and as long as we push it further we should see an increase in viable deck and archetype my only problem with this is that if the ben brode dream is actually true and we reach around 50 winrate with all classes WITH their tier 1 archetypes it just means that all they do is counter each other equaly and theres really no room for other archetypes  its really hard to argue that different winrates at current stages dont open space for new archetypes of prevalent classes to be made\", \"commentId\": \"25190\", \"commentDate\": \"1472766896\"}, {\"comment\": \"I agree with basically every  but lets not call people bad at deckbuilding  okay its just a low that no one needs
