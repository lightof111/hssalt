"[{\"comment\": \"Last 11 out of 16 opponents are all face warriors    again  The ladder has never been this cancerous before in terms of how disgustingly easy and coinflipbased it is  and combined with my ridiculous unluck thats currently in its worst state now  this game is just pure hell   usually  I can at least maintain a 6065 winrate during a season even with my shit luck  but now  its barely 50  Just tell me  with multiple top 8 open cup finishes  top 100 ladder finish  multiple top 10 reach  did I just forget how to play Sure  its not that everyone draws better than me  no  I just suddenly became bad  Just how low can my RNG reach Decisions  that generally should provide the extra 1015 winrate over these braindead idiots dont matter anymore  they just win  Draw better  point your mouse to the face and win  there is no comeback  Fuck this rigged fuckin shit\", \"commentId\": \"33270\", \"commentDate\": \"1488914373\"}, {\"comment\": \"probably my 1 or 2 complaint about the meta   your decisions dont really matter anymore  it just comes down to this deck wins 52 to 55 of the time vs your deck  and the extra  is in card draw rng  not decisions \", \"commentId\":

went through and clicked the first 30 warrior cards in my library  one of each  went to casual  and had as much fun playing random shit against a bunch of try hards as I have in ranked with a real competitive deck   Just stacking gold for Ungoro and if Ungoro is still shit  then Im just gonna stop playing forever and go back to Rocket League where skill is rewarded and luck happens occasionally
