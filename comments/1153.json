the one dude who starts being an ass  He starts taunting you while drawing near perfect  and all you can think is this is the beginning of some kind of losing streak isnt it  That seems to happen to me a lot\", \"commentId\": \"24101\", \"commentDate\": \"1471150027\"}, {\"comment\": \"So what the fuck is up with Cabalist Tome So pretty much all mages already have 2x fireball  frostbolt  forgotten torch  and arcane missiles  plus flamewaker damage  plus spells from spellslingerconjurer  plus additional fireballs from antonidas  So you can pretty much guarantee at least 663333 24 potential face damage from fireballs frostbolts and forgotten torches alone  24 potential face damage without including missile and flamewaker rng  roaring torchs  extra fireballs from archmage antonidas  extra direct damage from conjurer and spellslinger  or the dreaded pyroblast  This also doesnt include additional spell damage  reduced spell cost  or the fact that while doing this  they can still be making high board controltempo plays with all the great new midlategame cards they keep getting  There is a very real chance that no matter how much healing you do  a mage can still have 30 damage waiting for you as you get close to 10 mana  So what does blizzard do Gives them an extra 3 spells that definitely will contain even more direct damage without taking up cardslots  What the fuck is the point of playing any other class if i can just use this faceroll shit and get a handful of fireballs even after Ive used all of my other damage spells as removal Should a mage really be rewarded with free gameending face damage after making the choice to use it as removal This is fucking retarded  As a priest or any other class with healing  should I really have to worry on turn 9 that my opponent has 15 unavoidable damage in hand Well  they have that  and ice block so they dont even have to worry about their own hero  and a tome waiting to give them another 9 or so damage  in case the first 15 wasnt enough  along with the board they may or may not have  Play against a class with this much direct damage that is generated essentially at no penalty to them is utter garbage  Its like trying to block a round of bullets with a trashcan lid  AND you have to kill them twice\", \"commentId\": \"24102\", \"commentDate\": \"1471151219\"}, {\"comment\": \"priest sucks  Guess u r
