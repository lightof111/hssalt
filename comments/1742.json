Quest  I have a solution to bring down the retarded OP of the deck   Make charge so it cant hit your opponent   Theyve already taken steps in the past to nerf charge  now they need to take it all the way    Warsong Commander may she rest in peace  made it so only minions that already had charge got any benefit  Charge  Got changed so that it says It cant attack heroes this turn  Charged Devilsaur  Even in the new set  they came out with a charge minion that says Cant attack heroes this turn  Theyve already taken the first steps  now they just need to go the rest of the way   When the Quest Rogue has at least 6 minions with charge  and they all cost 1 mana  its a broken system   A majority of what I see on the ladder is now Quest Rogue  and this game is no longer fun   Do something quick
