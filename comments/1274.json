compliment for not being a brainless idiot of a player   Nope  they wanted to just criticize my deck and tell me it sucks   I got off one comment before they unfriended me like a coward   It should go without saying that if you are playing aggro shaman AND lose  then you keep your mouth shut  especially if your loss is at the hands of a poorly constructed shitty deck\", \"commentId\": \"26738\",

game instead  All the majority care about is getting legend which is a completely crap reason to play a game  And what lies behind legend Basically a card back unless you want to play competitively and need to accumulate the points   Its just a race to the bottom to find the quickest time in which you can end a game and rank up  hearthstone was my first ever experience of playing other people live in a game over the internet  Its been a lot of fun but also immensely frustrating and being annoyed and disappointed most of the time is not what I want  Im beginnign to concldue that PvP is not

ANYTHING but this stupid shit legendary that feels the need to MOCK me whenever Im slightly lucky  Blizzard  for the love of all that is good  STOP making one or two shit legendaries just to fill out the stupid expansion Sneeds Old Shredder is gone Nobody plays Confessor Paletress  You dont need to add any critical fumbles to cards like that  because I doubt you thought that far in the first place
