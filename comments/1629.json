theyre just unique bits of the game which bring something special such as Reno  Thaurissan  Rag  Sylvannas etc  The new cards and the new mechanics are all fucking dumb as hell  Jade is just plain stupid and buff Paladin is also dumb as hell  These kinda cards just take thought out of the game and make it all about how good your mulligan is  They are not exciting to play or fun to watch  its just endless jades spawning out or a paladin out of control by turn 5 cos he rolled 2 grimestreet informants or we they are called  Obviously this aggro meta is stupid as hell too but I didnt want to
