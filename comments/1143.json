"[{\"comment\": \"Losing with every high tier deck  you are definitely doing something wrong  Before watching good players on twitch  I thought that I made perfect plays  little did I know that I was actually doing a Miss play that will affect me two turns later  I have learned a lot last year and now I use my own decks and get rank 6 to 4 each month  like the deck in my signature\",

Maybe  but thats my take on it   So  I tend to play with fun decks that are usually tier 23 or worse and Im starting to accept that I wont rank up that high using them versus the onslaught of OP decks out there   It is what it is   I wish the deck choices were more diverse in standard but they really arent   Too many good cards are now gone and they destroyed too many good decks   That being said  try wild mode and see if you like that better   Wild is MUCH more diverse than standard and your options are much greater   Every class has at least one viable deck type if not more and the best part is that you have the tools to counter stupid warriors  annoying shamans  and hand puke zoo decks   Hell  ya dont even see most of those in wild  Sure  there will be a few secret Paladins and that sucks but there arent as many as people think   Overall  youll see a nice mix of decks using cards from naxx  GvG  and the WOG set   Karazhan will also be in there too which just adds more options  Wild is better than standard   Try it out\", \"commentId\": \"23893\", \"commentDate\": \"1470823345\"}, {\"comment\": \"you get liadrin if you play to 20 lvl in WoW  you cant buy it LUL\",

and there is nothing that we can do about it  but cmon  there is no way in hell that someone is so unlucky  Absolutely no way that you lose almost every game due to rng  The odds of that happening are abysmal which makes it extremely hard to believe  If it were true than you would probably be the unluckiest person in the world\", \"commentId\": \"23903\", \"commentDate\": \"1470827615\"},
