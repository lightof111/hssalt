Zombie Chow or Mana Wyrm  with Frostbolt  when my opening hand consists of Repentance  which I had to pick because the alternatives were even worse  somehow  and all my 5drops  when I mulliganned away my 4 and 9drops  and have to play 5 turns before seeing any of the 15 minions I have that cost 1  2 and 3 manaIm so done with Arena right now Shaman with no area of effect  no good minions apart from

another  usually some 3 mana 47 with light fetishes  The only fun part of it is when you get actually trolled for being such an annoying brat  and mostly that pleasure belongs only to shamans and ocasional mages  So stop it  try to do something respectable with your life instead of vomiting the same minion over and over again while trying to look ingenious  And naturally  this goes to shaman
