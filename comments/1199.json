as many different opponents as the original Mortal Kombat  It stagnates after awhile if you know exactly what everyone is playing  and its the same in Casual or Ranked  Thats my only complaint  and really  it could be solved with MORE NETDECKING Yeah  if there were just more viable options for great decks than the meager handful we have currently  there would be a lot more variety  I guess thats mostly on Blizzard for making expansions with only a handful of super amazing cards and the rest all just a bunch of Meh or outright garbage  Still  Im certainly not suggesting anyone stop with the Netdecking  as I do it myself without shame  but I also like to create my own deck and play it     Well  let me take that back  I like creating my own deck  its the playing it part that sucks\",

cards were warlocks  Oh  and forgot how some of these emoted me like 5 minutes example  one of these tempo mages      and no  I dont miss mech mage at all  Mechs disappearing was one of the things
