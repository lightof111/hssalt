"[{\"comment\": \"As much as I think the Rogue quest is interesting and fun  I hate playing against it since it always seems like a coin flip  Did they draw the nuts or not If they did  well fuck it theres nothing I can do and move on to the next one  If they didnt  hope they have bad draws and feel like the win was entirely because they had dead draws instead of anything I did\", \"commentId\":

required this expansion in proportion to everything in the past makes playing the game pointless unless you spend five times a retail game on card packs  I paid the 50 preorder and saved up another 60 worth of packs in Gold  and I cant even come close to building a good couple of somewhat competitive decks  Either you invest 100 into Quest Rogue or some shit which is about as dull as playing Pirate Warrior or you dont play  because its impossible to spread your collection over multiple classes here without being punished  Spent 3 Legendaries worth of dust on two quests and ridiculously strong Epics  only to find that if I want to try something else  Im just screwed unless I buy another few packs to bolster my dust  Oh  Ive given up all hope of getting useful cards from packs  at this point its just a matter of how much dust I can get per pack  And thats retarded considering Ive spent the equivalent of 120 on this expansion alone and before anyone gives me shit for equating gold to monetary value Id urge you to consider that time is just as valuable depending on how much you value it  I dont have time for this shit anymore  Plenty of other competitive card games\",
