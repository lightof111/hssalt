course he wins both flips even with a shitload of 2 drops in his deck and gets Houndmaster and a Savannah  Why the hell not right To finish it of he has 2 CotW in his hand as finishers   The rest of

Blizzard knows how to make money  Not everyone seem to be affected but there is an algorithm for sure and its designed to maximize profits  People who spend money are probably most affected because doing poorly in game will incentivize spending more money  Meanwhile f2pplayers  are not affected or maybe given favorable streaks in between losses which carries them  because Blizzard dont lose money on someone who will never open their wallet anyway but they can use these people for advertising   to give the illusion that everyone can be successful  Kind of like how Facebook use people for marketing  Fucking disgusting but nonetheless brilliant  Who knows how exactly it works  but no one can convince me that the game is not rigged\", \"commentId\": \"22732\", \"commentDate\":

moment  after another set of games with an 80 loss rate    I hate everyone and everything connected to this misanthropic  evil parody of a pasttime I hate all players who lacks the common decency to at least reply to a greeting from an opponent  You are playing against another human  you spoiled brats  treat them as such at least a bit I hate all the smug Catamites whos first emote is to say well played after curbstomping you beyond belief I hate the barely simian morons who emote a threat when you have already lost and just said well played I hate that some players seem to have decks specifically tailored against me  because I do not know enough to tailor my tactics against them I hate  despise and loathe any and all who even accepts the idea of bots being ok  Its only ok if you think other players are worth zero respect  you selfcentred  thoughtless  sociopathic lazy ingrates I hate the childish complaints about unbalanced decks or overpowered meta  and I hate the unbalanced decks and the overpowered meta I hate the entirety of the Internet which spawned this morass of polypathological  noncohesive mishmashes of contraintuitive fallacies And I hate myself  when I find myself saying fuck off at a screen  but directed at a person who did nothing worse than beat me in a game  fair and square  There is no excuse for that  even if they cant hear me But most of all  in a simmering  lowkey way  I hate those smug people who claim its just a matter of training to get better  It is not  Nor is it a matter of luck  or even just of natural talent  The one thing almost no one of these selfrighteous collections of unclean phospholipidsacks full of contaminated water seem to understand is that all skilled learning have one critical component that this game lacks the capacity for feedback  Learning from your mistakes require that someone is willing to tell you what they were and why  and you cannot get that from a screen telling you you lost  And you cannot get it from watching others play  It require interaction with people  not just opponents If you do not know what is wrong with a particular move  you will not know WHEN it is wrong  Especially when the skill element often is such a subtle part of the whole and only comes into play when the RNG happens to make for balanced plays  roughly equal draws and such\", \"commentId\": \"22739\", \"commentDate\":

it to be polite  for decencys sake  Its easy to forget that while they might be playing one of a limited number of heroes  they are still another human being and deserves respect When you sit down across a game board with someone for the first time  even if its a digital one  you greet each other or you are dicks  Its basic  politeness I do not mean this personally  but think about what you actually said  You straight out say that you make no distinction between the player and his deck  that all players of a specific deck is in a specific way and that you will actively block any attempt from them to show you you are wrong in your assumptions  You are effectively treating them as if they are not worth respect  that you are better than them  not as a player but as a human  I have
