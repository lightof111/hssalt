at least 34 blatant mistakes like hitting end turn before hitting with patches  using weapon charge before attacking with southsea  and a couple more and still won  I felt dirty like I just had sex with a prostitute when the game was over  As long as your draw is OK  even a moron is completely unbeatable with the deck  I really hope Blizz nerfs it somehow  Maybe at least make it so that charge minions dont get the 55 or make the quest all minions are 55 and they lose charge\", \"commentId\": \"36500\", \"commentDate\": \"1493828018\"}, {\"comment\": \"ID WIN BUT HE GOT FKIN GREATER HEALING

flipping coins  literally  all the time every turn Why are they so bad They just removed Ragnaros  another card they simply didnt understand the implications of  Rather than realize its extremely random and unhealthy  they only notice how many people were using it and so they axed it  accidentaly fixing their mistake  Hey sometimes even stupid people get it right  even if by accident
