such a waste of time to even try anymore  I really wish the game had an option where you could choose at least in casual to NOT play against any player whose deck included a few hated cards  So  I could choose to never have to play The Caverns Below or maybe one or two other cards that I despise  No downside to anyone   Im not seeking a higher rank  its just casual  And  my gameplay experience would be so  so much better  Not because i would expect to win more  I dont  and nor do I care  but I do want to play against people and feel the game was fair  and enjoyable  Imagine never having to see this quest again  or Patches the Pirate  Do I dare to dream\", \"commentId\": \"38574\", \"commentDate\": \"1496951385\"}, {\"comment\": \"Fucking cunt game   Getting really  really tired of the

pretty upset I still won the game but I was very angry  because I knew I won that game I think I might start RQing to Rogue Questers  they cant play if they dont have anyone to play against\",

take every turn to the rope and make the game just as enjoyable for the quest rogue as they make it for the rest of us  If enough people did this  it would act as chemotherapy for the ladder and

attack  if this minion takes 5 damage from any source  it becomes immune this turn instead  It would be a brutal wall against quest rogues and a decent antiaggro tool  but it wouldnt be an attacker in any deck  as silence puts it slightly above curve for its power and nullifies its immunity\", \"commentId\": \"38585\", \"commentDate\": \"1496982325\"}, {\"comment\": \"Will do mate \",

decks  Just lost enough games to drop from 16 back to 20 trying to win 5 games with Paladin quest  First game vs a priest who ran 2 mind vision 2 shifting shade 2 thoughtsteal 2 crystal oracle 2 mind control  Then about 5 consecutive mages with Alexa pyroblast or secrets I couldnt play round   Then some hunter  Then quest rogues  More hunters  Neatly all of them spamming emotes when they are about to win  Several hours of playing ZERO fun Ungoro sucks  Cancer decks and unnerfed cards  left on ladder for too many seasons  Out of principle now Blizzard will NEVER get another dollar from me again for hearthstone EVER  The concept of building a card collection and developing skill in this RNG cancerdeck fest is dead play the meta decks or dont bother  In before some congenital idiot tells me that quest rogue is Tier 3 at best or git good  those people are fucking douchebag fuckwits even worse than Ben Brode who is lower than rancid dogshit for what hes done to this game \", \"commentId\":
