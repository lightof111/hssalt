"[{\"comment\": \"To be honest  worgen warriors greatest weakness is warrior  not aggro  Tempo warrior can go face on them while the high health of the minions makes them hard to control  and CThun just goes to sleep under 40 or 50 Armor so even with the wildest worgen combo cant break them  After warrior  however  is aggro specially shaman the biggest problem for those shits  So they are more like a zombie plague trying to take over the world turning all players into Garrosh and sometimes Magni  Sometimes the disease fails kinda and they become some other orc  Conclusion Being an Orc in hearthstone is a disease that shall be eradicated  because thanks to some Old Gods  there is no longer such thing as a nontoxic orc  most have become infectious putrid corpses  and the others are practically extinct  and those that remains are so few that you will not even believe they exist\", \"commentId\": \"23260\", \"commentDate\": \"1469638572\"}, {\"comment\": \"It does not  not one

drawing your big minion and having it instantly removed the next turn  Classes have so much removal now that playing high cost minions just isnt worth it  When you make playing high cost minions not worth it  you force the game into a low cost minion meta that favors aggro decks  Just like WoW needed to reduce CC to make PvP more fun  Hearthstone needs to reduce removal\", \"commentId\":

{\"comment\": \"And there you go  what an epiphany  It doesnt  HS is a childrens card game  there might be some decks that require game knowledge  but thats hardly skill  Have you ever played something like Dota Now there you have a game that needs real skill  HS is something you can play while gently scratching your balls and reading a book or something  I sometimes play it during high intensity workouts and it never made my plays worse   The so called pros in this game are pros because they invest a shit ton of time in this game  thats what makes the difference  Talent is not required  you dont need any special abilities to be good at this game other than time and everyone who thinks otherwise is simply lying to themselfs to justify the time they spent in a cardgame  If you want a game that really needs skill go install dota\", \"commentId\": \"23280\", \"commentDate\": \"1469687930\"}]"
