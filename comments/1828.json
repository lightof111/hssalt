to save my life How is that possible Make those cards HEAVY AS FUCK  Bottom of the deck  Every time  Like    how do you mulligen all your 1 drops and shadow step How is that possible  Almost 95 of quest rogue gets ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL their needed cards every turn   Im still struggling to just draw living mana  its almost impossible  Oh wow  they complete quest by turn 3  amazing  Game was so amazed at this  it crashed   No other class can drop 4 1 mana cards that deal 20 damage  Lets not forget about the charge  Please nerf this  its been way to long without any kind of adjustment to this   8th quest rogue in a row  this is a fucking problem that NEEDS to be addressed  The odds of winning against this deck at 1100  Thats factoring in that you get the absolute PERFECT draw and he makes a mistake every turn\", \"commentId\": \"38330\", \"commentDate\": \"1496328937\"}, {\"comment\": \"I blame Blizzard not the players  theyre doing the same thing they did to WoW   Back in the day in WoW you could make some really interesting specs because of the talent tree   Then they started dumbing it down so the talent trees were pretty standard  sure you have a few choices on the talent tree now but its all pretty standard in what you pick   As long as they keep pushing class archetypes with the cards they release it wont get better only worse   The tribes  and specific synergistic class cards  are what is truly the culprit for not allowing different  fun  creative  decks imo\", \"commentId\": \"38331\", \"commentDate\": \"1496328960\"}, {\"comment\": \"Another match

off  And then the use of charge 1 mana cards that suddenly do 5 damage  then get sent back into the users hand  and then resummoned to do another 5 damage  is just absurd\", \"commentId\": \"38338\",

a 1010 for 2 mana no less by turn 5  Game 2  I switch to Warlock after seeing game 1  and I get cards with abilities like cant attack unless your hero attacked  Meanwhile my opponent has a full board of monsters  including a 68 taunt 3 health adapted by turn 3  Game 3  I try Warlock again  have a bunch of low cost  low power minons in my hand  and my opponent is again dropping bombs    two 56
