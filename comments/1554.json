{\"comment\": \"Wow Farnsworth  Ive never seen a Reno Mage on standard ladder before that Reno you dropped for  29 heal was a stroke of genius and a total surprise  I didnt see that coming  You must run only one copy of each card right It must have taken you aaaages to figure out what to include  Kudos for all that thinking and hard work  And the ice block  secret that saved you at the end  So clever dude  Amazingly wise of you to include that  however did you think of it Not sure of dropping Kazakas so early though  maybe something like Bran to combo with it And the way you said hello when the ice block triggered right at the end when you were certain of the win such creative  intelligent use of the emotes  truly I was in the presence of greatness  With such creativity and intelligence at your disposal  how is it your wildly original Reno Mage deck could be languishing at Rank 18 with my homebrew hunter You must have had a lot of bad luck dude  Congrats on your welldeserved win and I hope your luck changes for the better so you can climb to rank 5legend where a player of your intelligence and skill deserves to be  You should put a decklist up on Hearthpwn  other people might be interested in your deck I doubt anyone else has seen a Reno deck in this meta  share your wisdom around dude  And maybe a video on the emote use too  You stayed silent all game and it made the cheery hello right at the end seem so thoughtful and touching  Share your skills with the world  Such magnificent play deserves wider appreciation\", \"commentId\": \"32632\", \"commentDate\":

Terribly long  so I asked a friend of mine whos played this game far longer what Legendary I should craft  something good for nearly all Decks  His response was Ragnaros  and I happily crafted him  after collecting the requisite dust needed  Then in the year of the mammoth patch preview notes  they note that Ragnaros is one of the cards that will be moved to Wild only  therefor ruining some of my standard decks  and this only happening the day after I crafted him  too Had I known this  I wouldve stuck with my original plan and crafted Kazakus I am aware that I can still play him in Wild format  but I tend to dislike playing Wild overall  even though it does have less same deck  different player sort of feel to it  I wouldnt say Im mad  but a tad disappointed  perhaps\",

be able to play him in Wild  but you can manually disenchant the card if you dont plan on it for a net gain of 2000 dust\", \"commentId\": \"32635\", \"commentDate\": \"1487751673\"}, {\"comment\":

owl  COME ON  Stormpike commando is also a frequent traveler through my portals  And Ive seen Corrupted Sear travel  through my Moonglade Portal a couple of times as well  My last visit was from Madam
