obvious that it doesnt at ALL  Lets use Cunt fucking Mage as an example   By turn 3 they have two buffed Mana Wyrms out protected by little fuckhead taunts   The game is over if you cant clear that   Fact   No skill  its 100 draw luck   Or Huntard  if they open with a few of their OP minions  the game is over if you dont draw answers   I coukld go on and on   You win because you drew better  thats all   Nothing else to it   You lose when you dont draw well  Next game against Mage they dont draw anything good and you amazngly beat them  Gee  I wonder what the fuck happened  Why didnt the other
