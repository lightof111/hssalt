 What is this shit   Edit2 8 Weapons in the deck  I have really hard problems to get one early  I just dont know why  And while Im at it It doesnt matter if its Ship Cannon  Knife Juggler or the

arena runs 93  113 and 93 and was feeling good about HS for a while  I normally hit rank 75 at the end of a season and it is fine for me as I dont play that much  Well    all of a sudden the RNG gods decided to say Fuck you and screw me over big time  Drafted a warlock arena deck where I got garbage cards more or less all the way no clears  removal or anything  Think my best card was Zombie Chow  The run ended 13 because I started with two or three 5 drops in my starting hand had 4 and a lot more early game  all RNG went against me  the final run was ended because a mage played babbeling book and got flamestrike  while topdecking another flamestrike two turns later   Well   fuck arena  Ill just start climbing  Well NO I ended in a 12 game losing streak where I lost as Reno Priest  Dragon Priest  Renolock  Pirate warrior yea I wanted a win and FINALLY won with a Jade Druid where I faced a Renomage  So I went from rank 11 to rank 14  In conclusion I in my last 16 games I have won two of them  Ill take a break from HS for the  next couple of days\", \"commentId\": \"32537\", \"commentDate\": \"1487605189\"}, {\"comment\": \"Jade Idol must be removed from the game asap  if not  druids
