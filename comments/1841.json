"[{\"comment\": \"Do the bounce cards in quest rogue have a higher chance of being drawed than other cards Its six bounce cards but I swear every rogue I meet has all of them in their opening hands or something like that  Just managed to beat a rogue where I managed to play around a lot of his bounce things with various secrets mage  and despite I fooled him 3 times he still finished the quest on t6 or t7  All because he had all his bounce cards in his first 14 cards or something like that  I still won  Its just amazing they always draw them  I remember playing dragon priest preunguro  and I had SO many games where I couldnt draw any dragon synergi despite having 9 dragons in my deck or something\", \"commentId\": \"38593\", \"commentDate\": \"1497011651\"}, {\"comment\": \"they mulligan specifically for bounce most of the time\", \"commentId\": \"38594\", \"commentDate\": \"1497012451\"}, {\"comment\": \"Well of course they do  I have a lot of things I try to mulligan for as well but that does not mean I get them everytime\", \"commentId\": \"38595\", \"commentDate\": \"1497015110\"}, {\"comment\": \"Im just saying  the fact that they have 8 cards that bounce you can count vanish because they use it many times espec with prep a mulligan phase to try to get some in hand  at least 2 draw steps before they really start bouncing and 4 cards that dig them deeper into their deck mimic pod2drop draw means that the odds of them completing by t67 is very feasible every game  in fact thats probably average  45 is early and later then 7 means they drew poorly\", \"commentId\":

certain cards for synergy as well but then half of them were in the bottom half of the deck  But dude    its just salt\", \"commentId\": \"38597\", \"commentDate\": \"1497016809\"}, {\"comment\": \"I feel ya  i just get salty reading this about everyones hate on quest rogue overshadowing other things that are just as broken or more so   like primordial fucking glyph    i barely even see quest rogue on ladder anymore yet i get matched against mages every other game and that stupid card so wayyyyy to good\", \"commentId\": \"38598\", \"commentDate\": \"1497017730\"}, {\"comment\": \"I feel you there too mate Glyph is just so dumb reducing its cost by 2  It should have been like Shadow Visions where it adds a copy of a Spell in your deck but if it was like that more Ice Blocks would be in the game\", \"commentId\": \"38599\", \"commentDate\": \"1497019316\"}, {\"comment\": \"Ah  nothing like starting a day playing against 3 different Pirate Warriors    and each time  I fail to get

usual paraphernalia of Alexstrasza used defensively  Ice Block  and I bet also Ice Barrier  although it wasnt played  OK  Add NZoth  the Corruptor for bringing back deathrattle taunt and healing minions  still OK  I manage to bring his health down every time  But when out of a Kazakus spell he gets Lord Jaraxxus    man It felt like fighting one of those 60 HP heroic adventure bosses  I swear
