competitive game my Internet could support  And let me just say that it has been a shitty two years of this garbahe RNG coin toss of a game  Throughout the years Ive watched the meta mold into this boring  monotonous  repetitious cycle of spamming curve based aggro decks just to get a good rank  It seems that with every new expansion I miss the old days even more  I see people saying how they love this meta and its diversity but I just cant see how having a bunch of aggro decks and a couple shitty control decks is considered diverse  After all the disconnections  bugs  top deckdouble top deck losses and all the fucking money spent I am finally proud to say I am moving on  As of this week I will no longer be bound by my terrible Internet and I will get to leave this miserable game behind  Just like everyone else I always had hopes that blizzard would make this game great but its become clear that they dont give two shits about giving the people the game they wantdeserve  Every expansion is like being handed a shit sandwich and I personally have had enough  I know Im preaching to the choir but I feel so liberated in saying goodbye to this stupid fucking game  No more money will be wasted  No more time  Blizzard you had your chance to make this right but you didnt and so now you have lost one of your millions of customers  I know its not going to matter to them but it matters to me  Fuck you blizzard\", \"commentId\": \"37408\", \"commentDate\": \"1494865945\"}, {\"comment\": \"There should be a limit how many times you face same class on ladder   4th paladin in a row and usually if its not paladin next one is for sure  While Im writing that shit after a FUCKIN DIVINE FAVOR AND PERFECT CURVE  turn 8 tirion and Im dead now  dont wanna even watch  So I just went back to rank 4 cuz I faced 4 paladins in a row  Control is unbeatable and aggro just has perfect curve every god damn time  Tidecaller into Rockpool every single time  I mean cmon  I dont even know what they are doing on rank 3  ez legend those decks  what can even stop them Someone said shaman  If Id craft shaman  100 I would start getting different matchups     Fuck Divine Favor  I can handle everything else thats unbalanced  just fuck that card  I know its shit against aggro    kmee mee but do people understand that there is potential to draw 10 card  so lets say average for 3 mana cost is drawing 2 card  thats potentially 8 cards and if you are facing aggro potentially 0  so 2  So you always wanna run this shit in your aggresive deck  And please dont start with shit like play more cards stuff   otherwise I might find you and fkin smash your face\", \"commentId\": \"37409\", \"commentDate\": \"1494866059\"}]"
