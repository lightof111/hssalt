Blizzs old excuse of OldPatron being nerf because they want the game to be fun and interactive  There are more uninteractive decks now than ever before  You cant counter CThun  NZoth  or Yogg Thus  aggro decks will raise in popularity  In MtG a well placed Clash of WillsVoid Shatter would be able to counter any of these noninteractive cards CotW included  in HS you just sit and watch  And yes  you are correct about games being decided by card draw  I have been tracking my games this season and when I review the play by play  most of the time There are times where the opponent or I make a mistake there is nothing either one of us could have done to avoid a loss  This is bringing the level of anger and frustration over the top  If you make the correct plays and control the board  you should be able to win the game  The current state of the game doesnt care about correct plays or board control with those 4 cards mentioned above  Which is why an aggro deck will give you a better chance to win or at least your games are shorter and you can play more games  You kill fast or die fast\", \"commentId\": \"23247\", \"commentDate\": \"1469623855\"}, {\"comment\": \"Ok  I just got rank 5 with a homebrew and upto 50 of the opponents I met were agro shamans  I won most of them but seriously  have you guys got no dignity or shame That deck is so retarded  a mentally handicapped gorilla could play it and win  Do you really have so little brainpower  that you HAVE to play something on autopilot I dont know how many times I witnessed trogcointrog on turn one  How can you even feel good about winning with shit like that Its certainly not a matter of having skill  I can tell you that much  Alas  Im sure your tiny IQ cant comprehend it all\", \"commentId\": \"23248\", \"commentDate\": \"1469625671\"}, {\"comment\": \"See this is interesting   Scatter to the Winds    the whole Instant mechanic  Picture it    The player has to make a choice between spending all their mana on one turn to go all in on a full zoo board or big minion OR they leave a few 2 crystals left over to be able to trigger an Instant to prevent their opponent from some BS   Clash of Wills especially would destroy a turn 8 CotW or a turn 4 FF   Void Shattering the first Prep when the Auctioneer hits the board   drool  Even an instant buff on a small taunt minion could bait out the Charge win condition of some decks and stop it in its tracks  giving you a turn to react  This would also make Overload actually mean something  and would make Druid a bit more flexible and powerful  at a defensive cost of an Innervate   In theory  people should start to make choices about their decks and tech in other lesser seen spells and minions to get the other player to waste their Instants  and everyone is left making choices about their decks  strategically baiting out instants and removals  and we have to think about what were doing and why were doing it if we dont  it can and will be punished  The saddest part of all this  Im sitting here at work on a second screen dicking around I stopped playing Magic in 1996 and I play Hearthstone so casually that I do my daily quest and weekly TB and not much else   I reached Rank 10 once by accident and otherwise have no idea what rank I am or care and yet  I can sit here and come up with an interesting mechanic based on your idea  Professional designers  4 mana 77  turn 8 summon all your shit  turn 10 resummon all your shit  rogues draw your whole fucking deck for like 8 mana  shamans LOLverload  turn 6 109 for hunters  OTK combos  15 for 3 that gets bigger and bigger  heal for 30  and Gods you cant counter   GG   The fact that there are no Stop timers designed into the game kind of tell you that they never intended for Instants to be implemented  and they want you to be able to play a bunch of shit uninterrupted\", \"commentId\": \"23249\", \"commentDate\": \"1469626400\"}, {\"comment\": \"Daily fuck warriors post

fuck RNG  Let us have a game mode called standard with skill in which RNG does not play any role so no RNG cards like Flamewaker  except for card draw  If Blizzard guys are smart  they should be able

it as easy as possible for players who have played for a week to reach high ranks  No consideration for the ones who played when the game actually took understanding of value and trading  Alexstraszas Champion  Darkshire Councilman  Totem Golem  Flamewreathed Faceless  Thing from Below  Tuskarr Totemic  Call of the Wild  YoggSaron  Hopes End and others are crystal clear examples of how the design is opted towards pure power rather than more interactive cards  These are simply Play this and win the game  This is a despicable road towards failure  There are less legend players than ever atm  for a very good reason  But all of this couldve been acceptable  if you didnt decide to remove 2 whole expansions which were literally fundamental for the game  Now we are left without any options of

do we even play the game I have a great idea for the next expansion 1 mana minion that instantly decides who wins  5050  After some of the cards I have seen  I wouldnt be suprised if the retards actually print something like that  If you play yogg on ranked  you are an actual piece of shit  I dont care who you are  I dont consider you a person and will not treat you as such  I dont care if Yogg loses you the game  I DONT WANT TO FUCKING SEE IT  If you are at an intelectual level of a chimp and consider watching flashy animations with no strategic input fun  have some decency and go

decided after turn 1 or 2  what can t be good  I was never so bored  I am playing a very long time and got nearly every card  For what 7085 of my card collection is useless This game needs a swing  maybe blizzard should bring another gamemode like Build your netdeckingcanc    deck and after you win you are not allowed to play the same deck for the rest of the season  you have to change 1 or maybe 2 cards  So you could still play a very strong deck but after some time it will get weaker and you have to change to another decktype or class  Yes I know  this would mean you need some cards  but hey it s another gamemode  you can also still in standard or wild  If the game goes on like this  it will not get better  even the new adventure will change nothing  in 48 weeks we face the same
