to this shit      It really fucking is  It doesnt happen often to me anymore but sometimes this really triggers me  Whats the fucking point  P S To you fuckers who rope on purpose when losing Go fuck

style  they play it because they have a life as if its thinly veiled adhominem  Slower decks have always been a part of Hearthstone and there was something not too long ago showcasing that the people who play notaggro are usually older than 2325 this means that its far from impossible to reach legend with control decks if you arent a streamer  I dont necessarily have a problem with such decks in a

people or at least the ones who play control are usually the ones who cry like babies because of an aggressive deck in a virtual card game and decide to rope any inconvenient deck they encounter or get mad in other forms   And despite that you may not believe me  Im actually playing aggro  tempo decks because Im busy with other things  not necessarily because I have a life  I mean  if I had one

disgusting gnomes until they had deal like 6 damage to my face each Id run away to wild  but I already tried that in previous metas and it doesnt work    One or two years more of buccaneers  lethals

little more difficult because usually you have more cards in your hand and is harder to see the correct play and to plan ahead  Aggro requires you to do the exact same thing find the correct play and plan ahead  The difference is that with aggro you have less options and its easier to see the future turns   I mean  exploiting Pirate warrior is kind of like robbing a bank that is also on fire   No
