"[{\"comment\": \"Problem with Jade It gives tempo AND card advantage You cant have both in a game  You give one or the other  You CERTAINLY dont make it scale and CERTAINLY dont make it repeat Thats kind of the idea of Ragnaros  The turn you play him  he randomly gives you card advantage or tempo  stupid   IF he lives  he gives you more every turn But Jade cannot be removed at all  Its all battlecries  Not even deathrattles  The only one that is a deathrattle that you can ever deal with is Aya  and that thing gets silenced like theres no tomorrow Every other Jade card cannot be interacted with whatsoever and they just generate more and more card advantage and tempo as the game goes Cant do that  Pick one or the other\", \"commentId\": \"31423\", \"commentDate\":
