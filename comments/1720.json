powerful   At the very least  if you arent going to nerf the fucking quest which I highly doubt  then change charge so that it cant go face   You started the trend in this set  and you need to do it to all charge minions   This is fucking ridiculous\", \"commentId\": \"36079\", \"commentDate\": \"1493184097\"}, {\"comment\": \"Quest Rogue loses to Miracle Rogue a lot\", \"commentId\": \"36080\",

out the broken OP shit that is Quest Rogue  Its such a boring deck to play against  with literally no ability to stop the process of play from your side unless the opponent makes a misplay by being

most of them involve not having to deal with a board full of 55 charging minions on turn 5     If you play Quest Rogue for any reason other than needing to complete a Rogue Quest  you are scum  Period
