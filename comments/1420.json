come to the point where I only log in to do Daily Quests that are above 40 gold in value  The release of this new set was a disappointment for me  like it or not  thats how I feel about it   The following story of my own experience illustrates the things I find most annoying about this game  Today I receive a quest 50 gold  play 20 beasts  Okay  Im not a big hunter guy so Ill just throw together a crap deck made of the first beasts I come across  not bothering with synergy or anything just Ally Cat  Core Rager  whatever  pure Hunter Beasts  I put in 2 Explosive Traps and 2 Deadly Shots to round it off  Played enough games to complete the quest and during that period 1st Match Vs Jade Druid I throw down all beasts and go face without a care  He finally manages to get board control and squeak by with a few health points remaining his narrow win against random beasts with zero strategy was apparently emote spam worthy in his eyes  congrats 2nd Match Vs Secret Paladin The only reason I know it was secret paladin was he plopped out Mysterious Challenger on turn six before my random pile of beasts mowed him down  3rd Match VS Cthun Druid The random pile of beasts proves triumphant once again  In short  what I dislike about this game A random pile of creatures without any strategy behind them combined with hero power and a couple of spells can hold its own against current meta decks and even win against older type decks  and even when a guy managed to take a current meta deck and still barely beat a random stack of cards  hes going to be a jerk about it\",

and with coin close to 50  Its really not that weird that warriors have it so often  Just like Shamans so often have the trogggolem opening  or mages that so often have the mana wyrm turn 1  Its not nearly ALWAYS though  youre just remembering the negative instances and ignoring whenever it doesnt meet this expectation Simple test to confirm this to yourself  if youve played 10k games Im sure you played warrior yourself  and how often did you yourself not have FWA in your hand Pretty sure you can recall those  because here the negative instance is not having it  instead of actually having it every game As for the matchups  just track your games and see that youre mostly just a victim of confirmation bias  When I flip through months of logged stats  the opponent chart pie is often very normal compared to what the flavor of the month was regardless of class Im playing  When Im viewing alltime stats  the opponent stats are remarkably fair  Slight edge towards warriors and shamans due to the months of dominance  other than that fair splits  Myself for instance had the feeling that over 50 of my games since MSoG were versus pirate warrior  but when I check my tracked games it turns out its actually 18  which is more or less comparable to the stats the Vs data reaper is showing for class distribution this season\", \"commentId\": \"29775\", \"commentDate\": \"1482145093\"},
