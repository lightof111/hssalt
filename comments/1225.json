instascrewed in arena  Silly me didnt run an arena in ages  so went for pally  Then gets a really clunky deck with some really nice cardslike 2xTruesilver Champion and Consecration  but a fucked up curve and some silly shit like Moat Lurker and Darkspeaker  What do I fight against Mage  mage  mage  paladin  warlock  mage  One drops Lamestrike when I had no other option than go all in  after I spent the whole match playing around that stupid spell that the fucker obviously topdicked because it would have been a good play each of the last 5 turns I was trying to bait it without losing all my hand  Its awesome when this game punishes you for playing wisely instead of going allin like a dumbass  My opponent was so bad he didnt even killed my Moat Lurker with North Sea Kraken battlecry even when I killed another North Sea Kraken with the lurker  But who cares  when you have such topdeck skills  you draw the shit exactly when youR opponent cant take it any longer Then all was fine until the warlock  who happened to be a perfectly viable for constructed mech lock  Turns 12 play no card  then turn 3 Spider Tank  I have to Truesilver in order to protect my Boneguard Lieutenant  Then drops an effin Fel Cannon  so I lose that minion anyways  I play Maiden of the Lake so I can take that fucker down  trusting Fel Cannon might rekt him if he plays something  Well  there goes Clockwork Knight Maiden dead and now after killing the cannon I have a 55 and just a Darkspeaker to play  Then plays Dire Wolf Alpha and Piloted Shredder  so Darkspeaker dead and huge board to fight against  Trying to set up a Consecration  I truesilver the shredder  drops a Totem Golem And of course  next shit he plays is Stormwind Champion  because why not Give up and play next match  Last mage was an ok match  until somehow on a late game topdeck war I started not being able to draw in 6 turns anything that costed more than 2mana in a deck that was like 60 4 drops  Well  I lie  I could play one big drop  fucking Moat Lurker  so dead anyways  Oh  and a special fuck you to your 5 gold and raw commons rewards  you pieces of shit  Edited because I got so mad I forgot how to english\",

environment where no matter what you did or how you played  if you could not keep their board clean and your life total above 14  you were dead by turn 9  Now  the reason combo druid was so good and downright toxic was the reason that they played midrange minions that were hard to remove and chipped away at your life total which you could not avoid  and while clearing you fell below 13 or could not keep the board clear and lost  That was why they nerfed several strong classic druid cards into the ground  and rotated cards like Piloted Shredder out of the standard pool  So why in the world would you remake those cards  give them to the class who has the highest burst potential  and give them the combo in one card to boot Ah  right the average populace of the game wants to be succesful without thinking  making decisions  or even doing more than one action per turn  So since combo druid and secret paladin were no longer working  you gave them hunter back  Thank you Blizzard  that may keep your game populated  and you will keep your revenue up this way  but you sure as hell will be forever condemned for what you made this game which had the potential to be fantastic become and lying in our face about it  And in case someone tells me to switch gamemodes  arena is basically pick mage  open heartharena let them draft and play the game for you  and you will get some nice wins  Before i get any comments about how easy it is to counter hunter yes i know you can technically outface them if your deck has an average mana cost of 2 3 or lower  but if i wanted to compete solely on the basis of who can finish the game faster  i would play yugioh  Balance rant over\", \"commentId\": \"25687\", \"commentDate\": \"1473516033\"}, {\"comment\": \"Idk why but today in casual  there
