a thaurissan tick  this rogue with gadgetzan auctioneer draws 13 FUCKING CARDS and throws out a fat as shit vancleef  then conceals it  Only a paladin with equality and AOE or warriors brawl can clear

quit here and now  I cannot even fathom how a deck like that is allowed to exist  A deck that will draw all of its card when you have drawn 10  and then you are dead in 1 turn by 32 damage to the face

against zero skill pirate warriors  dragon warriors and Zoolocks today  why dont we just remove all this card shit and just roll 10 numbers and who ever has the most points wins the game  Because that

frustrating game 2 days ago  Playing Reno Mage against CThun Warrior  in control  I even stole his CThun with Sylvannas  Fireball  He had nothing  I was at 36 health with a lot of threaths to play

a chance against upcoming fatigue  I hate this  played good all game and about to win when RNG decides the outcome  Well  I dusted Majordomo Executus a few month back for better cards  I guess this is

any other deck I put together myself   This meta is no different and its fucking garbage  I used to think better of Wild  until it became apparent every Rogue is Mill and every Pally is secret  Same broken decks that these idiots cant seem to let go of  I will never reach legend while at the same time  wondering if I should give a fuck  No reason to when its about using the same shit everyone else does if you want to win  One more thing Yogg is the most illconceived card to date  bar none  Its also clear proof Blizzard has no intentions of evolving the game to encourage more fair

hit him with pyroblast in the face  what can you do with no board left   Edit yep  just had another one   this is bullshit  I dont have the stats on spells  but Im sure there are a lot more positive
