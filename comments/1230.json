to Flamestrike  in a single turn firelands portal inevitably hard removes a big minion while also summoning a big minion for the caster  I just a lost a game vs  a mage where the made had 8 HP left  I had Sunwalker 45 divine shield  a 23  and a 33 on board  and all he had was an ogre brute  He pinged Sunwalker  played FP  got a Venture Co Mercenary 76  So with a single card the board changed from me pretty much guaranteed a win  to me having a single 33 vs  a 42 and 76 The last Mage deck I drafted had 3 babbling books in it  I went 5  3  the Mage deck before that I drafted 3 Firelands Portals and went 12  1 The new arena changes are going to do fuck all to balance mages  they lose their worst removal spell forgotten torch  yipee  Firelands Portal needs to be a fucking epic  and Flamestrike
