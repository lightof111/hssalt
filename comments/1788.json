shaman whose deck was full of shit like mine  we were both playing terrible taking like 50 turns to deal 5 damage  it felt like 2 midgets showed up to a shootout with like plastic knifes and water pistols and we battled it out  I lost and moved on  and then next I face this pirate warrior and Im thinking    wow what a douche hes ruining the fun for people trying to do quests in casual  and I dont mean completing quest like this noob questrogue who put 5x 55s on the board on turn 4  thats not what casual is for  anyway Im getting annoyed  this pirate noob got himself a 54 waraxe and a decent board real quick  so I start playing some garbage  killing his noob pirates  get a lucky vulcano  and then it happens  this moron runs out of petrol and I finally get the board with 4 hp  and Im not giving it back I got 2 stupid 6 drop divine shield taunts  so he loses so hard  noob adds me and starts talking russian and I understand his broken english  hurr durr you rank 19 noob hurr durr me rank 10 spamming a 1v1 invite  I laugh at him for losing to such a complete shit deck and he gets mad and removes me from the list again  fking made my day this guy  he wanted to prove his skill
