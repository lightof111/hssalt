"[{\"comment\": \"how about a reno league for all those circle jerkers tired of this crap\", \"commentId\": \"30634\", \"commentDate\": \"1483805124\"}, {\"comment\": \"Im playing my own decks recently  not that I dislike netdecks  but it means Im stuck at lower ranks facing the same decks that those at higher ranks but with just terrible players  One guy managed to attack face with the last charge of his weapon  then Small Time buccaneer  then equip a new weapon  and he did not even rush the play  he took some time  later in the game  he randomly decides to my single minion with mortal strike when it would have put me in lethal range of his weapon next turn and he has 30 hp  some armor  what the fuck I mean  there are so many bad players at lower ranks  they take the time to read deck list online and theyre stuck at low ranks because they dont even think  the only reason theyre above of rank 20 is because they netdeck  But at least do a favor to newer players and those trying to have fun with different decks and learn to use the 3 cells needed to play any netdeck list  Pirate warrior is just an exemple  the list just goes on too long for reno players who seizes every opportunity to fuck up  I mean I managed to beat a renolock with a spellless buff hunter because he refused to trade with any minion who had taunt  even the best trade possible  I complain because its the week end I guess  low rank is better than casual mode or rank5 anyway imo  getting good games a reasonable amount of time the other days\", \"commentId\": \"30635\", \"commentDate\":

rest  You are playing at rank 14 and no it is not because RNG screws you over at all times  It is because you have still not learned the fundamentals of the game  If you had you would progress through

either asshole pirates  assshole jade or asshole Reno   Thats it   Standard is so fucking worthless that I cannot believe how badly this game is devolving   Reno is so god damned irrtating though   Midrange decks are now unplayable due to that moustached prick   Its still the most broken card in the history of card games   Way worse than pre nerf yogg    Theree is NO penatly to play Reno either   Warlock just removes and heals and so does mage   Single copies do NOT Cause a problem because there are too many removal and heal options that they can use   They just remove your shit  heal up  board clear a few times and then asshole comes out and resets their health   You are out of ammo now  Automatic win  What a fucking joke  if people are losing games using Reno then my goodness youre doing it wrong   Hes always drawn in time   Every fucking game   Cant wait until that cunt fuck rotates out of standard\", \"commentId\": \"30648\", \"commentDate\": \"1483830148\"}, {\"comment\":
