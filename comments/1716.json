your decklist  Theyve denied it so often that they probably cant come clean now for fear of a lawsuit  Real people spending real money on packs on the understanding that if they play a certain card in their deck it has a random chance of facing up against the meta  If thats a lie they deserve a class action lawsuit from anyone who has ever purchased a Hearthstone deck ever  Im not sure whether they are manipulating matchups to disguise winrate of broken decks  or to somehow encourage sales of the new expansion cards  probably that  but I simply do not believe matchmaking is random within nearby ranks ignoring your decklist  THE ENTIRE GAME IS A CON DESIGNED TO SELL PACKS OF CARDS WITH UNFAIR SYNERGIES EVERY SEASON  All you can do is resolve never to give them any money and accept your losses when you match up agains whatever the current cancer is  Gradually the game revenues will die off as people realise spending money on packs is pointless unless you want to do it every single sesason

eventually in two turns they take you from 30 to fucking 0 with the most non interactive bullshit that a piece of shit can pull out of its rancid ass  This is only after almost taking you to fatigue wasting even more of your fucking time  that could have went into two matches one at least having a much better chance to win or at least lose to something reasonable that requires skill to play  Mages are bigger scrubs than hunters and i doubt they ever win without the bullshit  We need our health upped to 40 rather than 30 because of those scrubs  No wonder there is so much aggro  its to kill those pieces of shit as soon as possible or waste as little time as they need to on the lazy cheats  I hope their families die in car accidents or something  and that they themselves get slow

the other day and thought itd be entertaining to play it on casual  I built a deck with a fair amount of survivability and card draw just so I could get it down and dick around with some new cards

the next turn  Game 3 I get through 23 cards without drawing it before I die  Game 4 I finally pull it out early on a turn 2 lifetap The opposing mage coins out a secret on turn two for some reason  I play it anyways its Counterspell  Mage  I dont know who you are  but I will find you    Game 5 Pirate warrior  Yeah  Game 6 I finally get it off early against a slow opposing deck  Shaman I end up with two copies of AlAkir the Windlord  That was pretty cool  Game 7 Another relatively early draw  Shaman again  Well this is less exciting  Game 8 Opening hand again I play it early  Shaman again

the Priest Legendary for UnGoro  not the Quest  the spell one   I dont think the cards given algorith is purely random  I think it has factors involving your play history and also the funding source
