scumbags are by adopting those tactics     Simply banished away    Saw a couple of pigrate disgusting Rogues  who get the allin yollo luck of their live    And could only punish an oppressor SMOrcer    Thats incredible All now are priests  mages      and    jade druids  those double disgusting scumbags who only serve two purposes make nazi aggro more viable  and punish hard the ones who are fighting to bring justice into this game  I spit on Jade Druid players face And my final thanks to Mrs  Brode  thanks for giving birth to he we know who  otherwise would be a harder task to pick the
