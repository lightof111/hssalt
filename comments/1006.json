"[{\"comment\": \"I dont usually bitch about specific cards but man fuck Yogg Saron sometimes  Im having a pretty good game playing midrange Priest vs midrange Mage  we are both making intelligent plays and employing a decently interactive back and forth strategy  It was a good well balanced game  until the Mage drops Yogg Saron  Suddenly my board is dead  my hero is down from 25hp to 1hp and Im staring at a Huffer thats charging in for lethal  Now it doesnt really matter to me that he won and I lost  wins and losses happen  but god damn it made feel like the entire match was completely a waste  Whats the point in wasting time thinking about your plays  trying to figure out the best strategy and then Yogg burst through the wall with his WILDCARD BITCHES routine and tosses everything youve done for the past 20 turns right out the window  It made me feel stupid for even bothering to play the match at all  in the end it was all decided by something that neither player had any control of\", \"commentId\": \"20975\", \"commentDate\": \"1464674988\"}, {\"comment\": \"My Nzoth Priest doesnt run circleauch because it is a minion heavy deck  I do run excavated evil but no priest

a ridiculous Yogg Saron  Whoever plays it because he thinks its fun it isnt  You dont play it competitively because its fun  you play it because it can steal games without needing any synergy  This is

card destroying me      i have never bitched or been aggressive in any other blizz games     but Hearthstone is just so frustrating in all aspects  Sure u realise when i do mistakes and shrug it of
