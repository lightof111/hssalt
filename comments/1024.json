Reaver is much more aggro than control  wich was the deck resulting  Im not really salty about Fel Reaver    well  if we forget that after playing a long attrition war  opponent could always still vomit hand instead of playing a big drop at a time  It ruined 1 match and won another  The rest of matches it was never seen  all was due to shit draws and how the hell did you craft that\",

used to really love warlock  with handlock  demon synergies  and arguably somewhat interesting zoo decks  I guess its just sad to see that all the class has going for it now is a really boring one

handlock unplayable  and i never felt like i was playing an interesting deck with synergies and carefully thought out card choices  but more like a boring off brand handlock that traded its unique mechanics for a chance at getting a boring full heal  Idk i guess i just really miss old handlock and the interesting class specific things warlock could do in the past\", \"commentId\": \"21365\",

require thinking  every turn requires decision making  The turn one of aggro shaman is not any more braindead than the turn one of control warrior or control priest  Control players choose to be on the reactive side  which means there is a layer of thinking that involves the question how do i deal with this threat  It is your choice to be in this position  so dont blame the aggresive player for putting threats faster than you because you choose to have a higher curve  Aggro decks has a layer of thinking that doesnt exist in control deck  which is what threat should i drop  and does he have the AoE clear  Turn one tunnel trogg is not any more automated than turn 7 flamestrike or turn 8 twisting nether or turn 5 brawl  You say my turn 2 Totem Golem is braindead Well so is your play to remove it with Shadow Word Pain  So lets stop ptetending that a turn 10 armor upjusticartank up is any more sophisticated than a turn 7 doomhammerrockbiterrockbiter  I need to think of how to kill you  you need to think of how to stay alive  If i achieve my goal easier than you  it is because my deck is superior andor my playskills are better   Or maybe it is RNG  but that couldve worked in yoir
