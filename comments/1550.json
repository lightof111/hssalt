"[{\"comment\": \"Yeah because it is Blizzards fault that everyone plays aggro shaman or pirate warrior  In fact  when you enter the game Ben Brode appears and aim you with a gun saying play aggro or you will die Dont blame Blizzard for people not being skilled enough to play a deck that requires some thinking  Its players fault to play only and only and only for win every single game without

breakdown of Hotform  then you can consider the source who made the video   Hotform whines and cries about every aggro deck he plays against Hotform thinks playing an aggro deck takes 0 skill   Yet  his cognitive dissonance couldnt be more glaring in this regard   Because hell play a deck like Dragon Priest and claim the skill is so superior over an aggro deck   Oh yes  playing dragonfire potion to clear a board  and pick Drakonid Operative off Netherspite almost every time its offered takes much skill  Hotform is literally paid to play this game   So  of course he can sit there and play 30 minute control mirror matches and not care   Hes making money while he plays  is paid to play subsdonations Sure  before the accusations fly  Ill freely admit I play Shaman   I play Shaman because retard Reno decks have obliterated midrange decks my actual preferred type of deck  and Shaman is just about the only midrange deck left that can still win consistently  I dont get paid to play this game  so I dont have timepatience to sit around and play 30 minute matches  Please stop thinking any deck in Hearthstone takes any skill   The days of skillful deck piloting are long gone  please stop deluding yourself that the deck you play requires skill  For everyones sake  I cant wait until RenoBrann rotate out  I cant wait for the STB and conceal nerfs  and I definitely would love to see Hunter and Pally become actual playable classes again in the next expansion  The reality is people have to stop shifting their focus on blaming Blizzard for a class  and start demanding they stop being lazy and make every class viable with several playable archetypes  Also  hopefully  maybe some day they can bring skill back to the game  but I wont hold my breath on that    Edit PS This post
