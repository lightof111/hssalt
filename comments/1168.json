Karazhan released and I started doing some statistics   Played 134 games  43 Face shaman 26 Zoo warlock 18 Dragon aggro warrior A measly 13 control decks It doesnt matter that I am slowly climbing the ranks  It forces you to play something very antiaggro even if you d rather play something more fun and controlish  There is absolutely NO fun playing these aggro matchups as they are to 90 decided who gets the best draw  I wouldnt for the life of me ever go play these retarded decks  Its as much fun and skill as staring into a wall  No actually staring into a wall might be even more fun  The fact that the playerbase decides to almost exclusively play these horrid decks and Blizzard instead of preventing it they more or less encourage it by releasing just worse and worse control cards while adding in some fast high damage cards for the aggro decks  The game I used to love  and can love is still just a fucking aggro mess and it doesnt help that all the fucking aggro players always gives you a Thank you or Astonishing whenever they destroy you  like they actually did something skillful  So no Blizzard  I say FUCK this game until you fix this shit  70 of my friendslist have already quit because of this so I guess I hung on longer than most but now I just cant take it anymore  Maybe I ll go play some mage in arena  Or Rogue  If you dont get one of those 2 classes you might already retire your deck and hope for a mage or rogue the next draft since they are so incredibly overpowered  But at least Arena requires some thinking once in a while and not just clicking face and playing out everything in your hand until you opponent is dead over and over again  endrant\", \"commentId\": \"24407\", \"commentDate\": \"1471612278\"}, {\"comment\": \"I dont mind Shaman in

asshole playing another warrior or shaman can go fuck themselfs  I honestly think hearthstone is best played with fun gimmickie decks  the only real rule is to stop caring about rank and winrate  Every fucking retard with enough time and 2000 dust can reach legend  its not about skill  its about a mindless grind  so you might as well just play something really fun and stop caring about something that basically only requires a shit ton of time instead of fun and skill\", \"commentId\": \"24412\", \"commentDate\": \"1471619144\"}, {\"comment\": \"arcane giant aka 0 mana 88  such fair
