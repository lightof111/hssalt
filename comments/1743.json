the Headed to legend thread how successful my month was  Only to impress people I dont know  and most likely never will know  Why do I have to reach legend every season Why do I have to play 300 games of Hearthstone to reach a rank youll never get anything out of  besides bragging about it Hearthstone is a shallow game  and I dont know why I play it   But I will play it more  I will reach legend
