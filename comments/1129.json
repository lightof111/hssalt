"[{\"comment\": \"This If you play anything but the 3  5 Uber Tier decks  you are going to struggle  a lot I constantly ask myself WHY Why BlizzardWhy do I need to choose between losing against droolers or playing cancer decks myself   I did stop playing this abomination of game a while ago  but currently I cant really play too many other games bc I broke my arm a couple of weeks ago  My right hand arm and wrist in a Bike accident  So its either this game or solitair  I might actually switch to solitair at this point  I dont enjoy playing the game  Wins are shallow and sad  losses are infuriating and depressing    Yet this game is somehow addicting  Hence the thousands of literal Hearthstone kids who would scold me for such a comment as a whiner and loser    Salt  So funny much

topped decked  He then beats me while spamming the Oops emote like he has the whole game  After that he sends me a friend request  which I accept to see what idiotic thing he has to say  He then proceeds to complain how he hates all the noobs playing the RNG monster that is CThun and tells me to get good and play a deck that requires skill  He then proceeds to unfriend me  The funny thing is that he was playing Face Hunter  which according to him has a high Skillcap  I know CThun decks arent that difficult to play but anything has a higher skillcap than Face Hunter\", \"commentId\":

enjoy the game instead getting stressed  1 Try to play different decks or classes  dont  attach yourself too much to a single one    you get frustrated when you lose alot whit that class and you invested so much on it  2 Dont hate a class or a card because you lost to it like omg i hate Yoggsaron so much   i will never play that card then you realize how fun it is to play it  this applies to any class or card  3Accept the meta system   this meta favors certain classes   then it will shift  if you want to rank up fast whit less effort  you should try to play those classes instead fighting the wave whit priest or whatever  Of course you can play different fun decks while ranking  but then dont get mad if you lose alot  4 Dont play priest right now   its bad  standard\", \"commentId\":

hero power  The actual face hunter deck that everyone complained about died long ago  however  Primarily because of cards getting rotated out or nerfed   Maybe some people try to attempt it again with their own cards  but it would be nothing near its old power  The only consistent  viable hunter deck right now is midrange  And midrange hunters are largely about vying for board dominance and then going face once they have it  This is helped by eaglehorn bow and infested wolf which adds some stickiness  and then highmane for late game     Hunters will always be SMOrc simply because of the nature of their hero power  However  face hunter is dead  Midrange is more board controloriented than anything  Theyre not going to ignore your large minions unless they get huffer because you just always have to go face with huffer\", \"commentId\": \"23585\", \"commentDate\": \"1470264190\"}, {\"comment\": \"I feel this is great advice  I am taking a break from the game but in my everyday life I am trying to increase my levels of patience to improve thinking making and anaysis of events  Your overview of the game is brilliant in my opinion and helps me a lot  Instead of me fighting to go against the current I should hop aboard and enjoy this meta  In a sense I should view each meta as a themed party  such as 70s night or scary halloween party  I wouldnt show up to one of these events wearing a completely different outfit  as I wont win best dressed if I do  Now I can choose to wear my favourite costume that isnt related to the party and be happy with it  but I have to understand it wont win me best dressed unless Its a very very good costume  the same goes for being a very very good player  Just reading your synopsis has been very theraputic for me and I wanted to say thank
