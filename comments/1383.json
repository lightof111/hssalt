fun by simply playing it  For instance  I built a Dragon Buffadin that I enjoyed every minute to play with  even against pirates  Even though I lost the game against that pirate  I was still excited to play more with the deck and didnt care if a random stranger considers himself superior or is just happy because he beat the crap out of me in Casual\", \"commentId\": \"28994\", \"commentDate\":

 Im not figuring out strategies or actually even playing  Im just pressing find match  playing 24 cards  losing  then repeating  Im sorry  but thats just not fun in the slightest to me  Its almost the

actually have a fun match but having fun 10 of the time while playing a game No thanks Blizzard needs to stop making facedecks so good  We might as well have in played out for us  Cards are played on curve and the draw mechanic is the same  Pretty much exactly the same amount of decisionmaking every pirate face deck makes so why not make it play on its own\", \"commentId\": \"28997\",
