decks  I tried to play some midrange  tempo and I either get pwned by agro player who goes like FACE  END TURN  FACE  END TURN  FACE END TURN or I get pwned by skilled Reno players who play like AOE n 1  END TURN  AOE n 2  END TURN  AOE n 3  RENO  END TURN AOE n 4  GG  Seriously  was it so important to give Priest  Mage  Warlock those AoE potion damage spells  potion from Kazakus that also fucks the board  chance to discover another AoEs from the discover minion There is just no way to develop a board these days so yeah    midrange is dead boys  Also  fuck priest  I was playing jade shaman and I got a bit unlucky with only 11 golem in turn 6 or so and that fucker already somehow had 11 22          66 through thought steals and god knows what\", \"commentId\": \"28962\", \"commentDate\":

to uninstall it but I keep telling to myself that it will eventually get better  Yeah  sure   In the future  I will only play this game to get the new card back each month  it doesnt matter if I make a deck myself or copy one off another person I still fucking lose about 80 of the time  I dont consider myself a good player but I am certainly not a braindead one either  saw many people play much worse than me and still win games because of either good draw or some card RNG  In the end  this game is infested with RNG and the dev team simply doesnt want to change anything  So fuck you
