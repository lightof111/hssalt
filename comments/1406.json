\"Im sure there are many stories like this one the past few weeks but here it goes  The game starts and my mulligan didnt look bad  I was playing a Renolock and had Felfire Potion in hand but not much else  it wasnt great  Seeing as I was facing a warrior I needed a more aggressive hand so I mulligan my hand and end up with Faceless Manipulator  Emperor Thaurissan and Reno Jackson  This mulligan was worse than my last  the only positive was Reno that might save me if I last till turn 6  Now that was my mission  outlast the onslaught  Turn 1 I get Twisting Nether  I pass  his turn 1 he plays coin and 2 SmallTime Buccaneer and the obvious Patches the Pirate came with them  Turn 2 I get Shadowflame  I tap and get Power Overwhelming  His turn starts and plays a Fiery War Axe and goes face  I am at 17 now  My turn 3 starts I get Defender of Argusand I am desperate for an aoe so I tap since I had nothing to play and get Sylvanas Windrunner  At this time I am beginning to realize that turn 6 will never get here  His turn 3  he plays 1 upgrades turning his weapon from 31 into a 42  and plays that 21 pirate with charge  he goes face and now I am at 2 HP  I cant tap but I manage to pull the aoe I needed but it was too late  I played Demonwrath and then he proceeds to BM and wait till rope comes up and then goes face with the axe  You got to love them pirate warriors  play a cancer deck and BM when you win \", \"commentId\": \"29477\", \"commentDate\": \"1481595940\"}, {\"comment\": \"ya know  im trying to be a  new  person and be more zen but jesus christ   you cant even take zoo

like yourself playing for a Quarter of a Year is considered new to me  there is a lot to learn before getting 7 wins  Using tools like heartharena is a good step  but you need to get a firm grip on the most played cards for each class  and how certain MUs work in Arena  Itll take time  Besides the things pointed out  get someone to coach you for a few runs  itll speed up your understanding  Best of luck ive played 90 Arena until my collection was pretty much full  if you play on EU id be willing to help you out on a few runs if we find the time  just add me and well see how far we get  if

hearthstone  i was playing midrange hunter  he was playing druid  he spammed his hand full of 1 cost minions like lepper gnome and other shit on turn 1 with innervate he did absolutely nothing but went to face entire game  he even had freaking elven archer and he shot me face with it  his hero power he used to attack my face as well  i managed to play loatheb and savannah highmane  the druid kept spamming 1 and 2 cost minions and still went to freaking face  he like completely ignored my entire board  i managed to trade all his small minions and drop him down to 15 hp  he roped his entire turn and spammed Greetings emote  then he plays stonetusk boar and goes to face with it as well with hero power  he though he had won  i had 1 hp left then i finally managed to get call of the wild and end game and all but seriously all he did was went face  its disgusting\", \"commentId\": \"29485\", \"commentDate\": \"1481637659\"}, {\"comment\": \"Im so unlucky I cant even complete my quests

12  11 final game before going into rank 10  met the fucking scum of the earth deck that is pirate warrior  Draws so perfectly  got the perfect hero power off finley  even mistress of mixtures and farseer and refreshment vendor and reno ended up being useless  Next game  fucking aggro shaman  I managed to clear and heal enough to go into the late game and stabilise  left with 3hp  was going to secure the win within the next two turns  opponent has a healing totem on board and topdecks rockbiter and sprinkles in a nice little well played before smorcing me for lethal  next game  another brainless pirate warrior who ALSO MANAGES to play every fucking card on curve while my entire hand is dead till turn 6  Following that  bming priest manages to discover reno from my deck to win out in fatigue  top it all off with another aggro shaman who just keeps topdecking burn spells and of course eventually topdecks lethal as well  guess blizzard really likes to make you think that you are going to have a good day of playing but then does a 180 and buttfucks you with shit rng and a 5 game losing streak as well as a fuckload of brainless aggro decks as well as people who decide its a fun idea to bm thinking they are pro as shit winning with brainless and cancerous decks like these  blizzard really needs to get their shit together and do something about this dumb aggro meta like it seems like almost every meta has just been about brainless smorc decks  I thought the new expansion would bring a least a slower meta BUT NO a big fuck you from blizzard it is  also imo there should be a way to directly report bming cunts in the game without needing to add them as a friend or whatnot  eradicate these kind of people from the game and the world would be a better place tbh\",
