complain about stuff they havent even tried out  they expect all new cards to be made specifically for already existing decks and judge the cards only in regards to their use in those already existing archetypes  they want minion types to be following predetermined rules and never ever have for example a beast in warlock or paladin  where there is no obvious synergy  they want every single card to be competitive on high ranks  they can imagine every card only exactly on curve and only in the current meta and then they say the whole expansion sucks  before even half of the cards have been revealed  it drives me nuts and sometimes i have a really hard time remaining calm when reading stuff like that  but still i cant resist the urge to look into the comment section  because there might be some interesting or funny ideas\", \"commentId\": \"34291\", \"commentDate\": \"1490731834\"}, {\"comment\": \"I have to admit  Im a jerk  Playing in casual with a homebrew Rogue burgle deck with a

decks because we havent seen all the cards   a lot dont like volcanosaur  i think its a pretty good card lol becuase a 7 mana 56 guaranteed to be an extra couple of things seems preeeeety good but i
