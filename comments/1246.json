Firelands portal  which removes one of my minions and SUMMONS A FUCKING SLUDGE BELCHER Firelands portal was infinitely better than flamestrike against a board with 5 minions on it  and it is a fucking

minions are simply a vessel for the exploitation of other broken cards in the game in my opinion  The existence of charge for example creates more justification for aggro players to put cards like Abusive Sergeant and Dark Iron Dwarf in their decks  These cards subsequently become ABSOLUTELY UBIQUITOUS CARDS responsible for a stale meta  But the fact that aggro players will play Wolfrider  Argent Horserider etc simply because of the value of charge as a mechanic is proof in itself that there is something wrong here\", \"commentId\": \"26143\", \"commentDate\": \"1474371415\"},

\"commentDate\": \"1474385811\"}, {\"comment\": \"We didnt need any new charge cards because the same ones are already being used too much I would like there to be a situation where Charge cards are used because of something unique about their stats and value  not simply because they have the word charge on them  Fact is you can create a workable deck by using the strong basic and common cards of classes like hunter and Paladin and filtering by the word charge to find the best charge minions  You will get wins with such a deck  Try doing the same but replacing charge with taunt or divine shield and you wont have such a great deck   I DONt want to see Charge erased from the game  but I think it might need to be penalised by higher cost if Blizzard ever hope to slow the meta down  I think Doomguard is fine for example because of its drawback  however its cheap neutral charge minions by and large which synergise with stuff like Abusive Sergeant to create the aggressive meta which the world and his dog complains about\", \"commentId\": \"26153\", \"commentDate\": \"1474386921\"}, {\"comment\": \"I just met someone who tried to revive secret paladin in standard  I won  but come

of how many charge minions does shaman use    only Argent Horserider  and only sometimes  The real problem is how imbalanced are the small minions against the big ones  First example  why is it that Abusive Sergeant has average 1 mana stats  but Dark Iron Dwarf has low 4 mana stats Or Faerie Dragon having nice 2 mana stats while Spectral Knight had average 5 mana stats Or the most obvious of all  Flamewreathed Faceless against War Golem  Charge itself is not a problem to the game  the lack of straight good taunts or alternative ways to protect face dont know  something like intervention whenever a minion attacks your hero  attack it first   What we need is an actually good and not circumstancial taunt or sort of taunt like the old Sludge Belcher well  maybe a bit weaker  because Belcher was OP or borderline OP  but not taunts that only work in certain decks only viable for classes that already master control like Twilight Guardian and Wyrmrest Agent  or for archetypes that can never compete strong enough by themselves Sparring Partner and Fierce Monkey could never push taunt warrior over dirtass fatigue  and The Curator decks just failed\", \"commentId\": \"26155\",
