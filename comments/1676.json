"[{\"comment\": \"What grinds my gears as of recent Well playing casual in EU totally sucks  Retards that spam emote and then notices that heshe is checkmated  Goes all quiet and doesnt have the fucking balls to add me  Yeah I would roast the shit out of them but what do they expect after giving me such treatment Being cocky and then losing  Like stop acting as a fucking 5 year old  Stop being such a fucking pussy ass loser and accept that you lost AND you were being a twat  I find it just a lil unfair that I have to withstand the bullshit and then the fucking twat just gets to walk away  Hmmm Blizzard  this is legit unfair  I played different mmo games where you could actually just type out in public but no  in hearthstone  all you can really do is fucking emotes  which feel so fucking condescending  The only way is to try to get the person to accept your fucking god damn friend request  Why cant we just fucking type instead of these bullshit emotes In other games  you can type whatever and yes  there is a filter and an actual reliable report system  Shitt  man I am triggered lol   p s why the absolute fuck are people playing the most cancerous competitive decks in CASUAL but I see more people playing and experimenting with new decks in ranked I makes no fucking god damn shit bitch sense\", \"commentId\": \"35164\", \"commentDate\": \"1491955527\"},
