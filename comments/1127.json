from RNG too so that kinda sucks  its funny how  2 decks below 70 score can get 12 wins because they are aggro and the strong midrange i drafted did only 8 although yeah i was very unlucky\",

Fucking sublegend shitlords playing retarded decks that I absolutely guarantee do not fucking work 95 of the fucking time but they get lucky against me and me only Winning every single fucking 5050  3367 and more Not playing around meta cards that Id obviously keep in hand but never getting fucking punished because shittier players obviously get excellent RNG only against me Its fucking broken how fucking bad players who are obviously worse than me by virtue of both deck construction and piloting can always manage to win against me just because of some fucking bullshit juggle  and the worst part is it always happens to me  Its fucking retarded how 50 of my wins are in spite of me getting the worst possible RNG and my opponents drawing the nuts How I can fucking lose games or even derank against these fucking subhumans honestly makes me wonder why the fuck people play this game When I lose a game to fucking zoo who taps last  rogue who coins dagger on turn 1  control warrior who shield blocks on turn 3 in a control matchup  or shield blocks before hitting with axe etc   it makes my blood boil that when afterwards I analyse my plays with a fellow top 100 level player  we find that I played perfectly or almost perfectly and still lost  i e  there was no way for me to win that game  This game is honestly fucking disgusting that it allows for bad players to consistently beat me  The fact that I had a much  much higher postlegend winrate than prelegend winrate when I started climbing midseason last season after a long break from HS because of bullshit like this  albeit from a smaller sample size  shows just how fucking stupid this game can be  where often there are times when skill just doesnt fucking matter at all  Every single time I launch this game I think maybe it will be different  maybe I wont end up losing to complete fucking plebtards just because they get lucky and win THREE FUCKING 5050s IN A ROW IN ONE FUCKING GAME  something that wouldnt bother me if it DIDNT HAPPEN EVERY OTHER FUCKING GAME ON AVERAGE  but that  of course  would be too much to ask  I know a lot of you will be screaming confirmation bias and whatnot  and for a long time I thought so too  I thought that I was just being entitled  wallowing in selfpity  thinking I was better than I was at the game and whatnot  but everyone who has spectated me has confirmed that my RNG is some of the worst that they have ever seen  Now Im not saying that Im a pro level player or I should be ranked 1 in the world or whatever  because I shouldnt  I still play worse than most of the top level pros  who make one minor mistake every 10 games or so  a level of consistency I have to grind back toward but it is incredibly discouraging that no matter how much I try and improve  I will still lose to some fucking lucker shitlord who juggled my 31\", \"commentId\": \"23550\", \"commentDate\": \"1470221079\"}, {\"comment\": \"Turn 7 coin call of the wild  okay i dealt with it  turn 8 call of the
