"[{\"comment\": \"Im a European who is going to be affected by the future pack price increase  Im quite new to Hearthstone installed the game about 5 months ago and when I got it  I quickly got hooked  At first I was not keen on spending money on packs  as they are incredibly expensive 10 for 7 packs What but eventually I decided to spend some money on it  Really expensive for stuff that I didnt use in any of my decks  The only I thing I enjoyed was the adventure I purchased  League of Explorers  It had fun mechanics and Legendaries that were actually playable   I didnt really want to buy another adventure  afterall  the next year for Hearthstone was just around the corner and there would be an adventure for that  right Nope  They give us more expensive packs and a shitty new Adapt function  At this point  I am a little annoyed but whatever  Maybe the new expansions of packs will give the meta a refreshing new taste  considering how stale and boring it has been lately  Maybe  I thought  theyll lower the price of packs so new players have a better start in the game if you believe that someone who invests money and has all of these PayToWin legendaries is a fair matchup against someone with very little legendaries then you are either moronic or in denial  Fucking no  They raise the price of packs  Hearthstone is in a completely fucked state right now  Players are leaving from the shit meta and now  as the cherry on the cake  they are increasing prices of packs for nonAmericans  Is this a joke I believe that Blizzard knows that their game is fucked  Theyre the ones who fucked it  afterall  Pirate Warrior and Jade DruidShaman is an example of that  So because they know their game is fucked  they are trying to squeeze as much money out of the fanbase as humanely possible before Hearthstone fully dies  Well  I hope what theyve done kills it sooner  They can either fix this problem  and reclaim some of the fans they just lost  or they can drink another glass of champagne in their mansions while Americans pump more money into their bank accounts and Europeans leave to play other games Gwent doesnt look bad  By the looks of things  Blizzard dont really give a damn about the community so I highly doubt that theyll so much as consider fixing the price  Why would they Theyre making money  and to them  thats all that matters  To conclude  Blizzard dont care about the games state and just want money  To do this  they are attacking the community in a final effort to make some money  This will hopefully kill the game and we can all move onto something like Shadowverse which I have yet to try but heard good things about\", \"commentId\": \"33541\", \"commentDate\": \"1489337592\"}, {\"comment\": \"What midrange are you countering in
