something called  ranked  This happy warlock thought to itself  Yeah I got this    Using its budget zoolock deck  it entered the danger zone  It is time to shine It exclaimed before taking its seat and awaiting its opponent when  suddenly  a paladin arrives taking her seat with her fancy card back  Lady Liadrin   a name I will never forget  I was about to concede at first meet  for her shining armor and blue fancy card back were far too much for my newbie eyes to bare  Quickly  Magni  the warrior  flung his hand out onto my shoulder and cried out  What are you  stupid Dont give up just because she has a better appearance than you Or because she has a better card back than you Go on   give it a try Ya got nothing to lose  lass With that  I felt confidence I felt strength I was all powerful   10 minutes later After many cards from the NZoth Paladin net deck were thrown at me  I finally chose defeat You win   this time  That being said  I turned to Magni and said  I told you I should have conceded instead of getting completely humiliated    All Magni had to say was  So sorry  my friend    Credits Story written by a beginner to ranked Magni played by a pro to ranked Warlock played by a noob to ranked Lady Liadrin played by a faggot\", \"commentId\": \"22372\", \"commentDate\": \"1467678022\"}, {\"comment\": \"less than 10 chance he has any given card  but of course the
