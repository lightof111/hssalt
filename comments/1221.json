board over the first 5 turns  Turn 6 he plays Thaurissan and follows up with Sorcerers Apprentice Antonidas  CoinArcane Intellect Missiles  Blast on turn 7  4 free Fireballs and a massive threat on the board on turn 7 is pretty insane for him I think  He proceeds to Fireball me in the face 4 times the following turns until I play Grom  He casts Yogg and clears my Grom  plays 1 paladin secret  casts Cabalists Tome Light in Darkness Light in Darkness Animal Companion and Pyroblasts my face  He then plays Faceless Summoner from Light in Darkness and a few more minions  I am forced to Brawl his board or risk dying next turn  He then plays Rhonin and I am forced to Deathwing as I couldnt clear it  Turns out the paladin secret was Repentance so I couldnt do anything to stop the 12 points of damage incoming from the 3 Rhonin missiles  Cult Sorceror  Game 2 Patron Warrior fills the board with Patrons on turn 7 and I dont have my Brawls so I am forced to clear them the hard way  He proceeds to fill the board again on turn 9 and I still dont have either of my Brawls  Later on with over half my deck drawn he plays Arcane Giant Charge Faceless Manipulator but again no Brawl  Dead next turn  Game 3 Midrange Hunter has an amazing start and pushes me to low life and I am stabilizing with a taunt in my side alongside Rag  I will kill him next turn so he topdecks Barnes  plays him  he summons Rag and his Rag kills me  Game 4 Ressurect Priest plays 2 Loot Hoarders the first 2 turns but all his ressurects and Bishops dont bring any of them back  At turn 8 he plays Forbidden Shaping and gets Ironbark so I brawl his 4 minion board but the 88 survives so I am forced to execute it  Next turn he plays Ysera but I dont have my hard removal because I wasted it on his 88  I deal with his Ysera over 2 turns so he follows up with Rag  I kill it and am stabilizing until he plays Bishop and Ressurect and gets Ragnaros and Injured Blademaster back   Game 5 NZoth Warrior does his thing and proceeds to cast NZoth turn 10  I Brawl his board but next turn he casts Golden Monkey and plays a Thaurissan that he got  Hes got 21 damage on the board but I have over 45 life so I dont play my Yogg and pass turn to get more value next turn  He proceeds to play Cenarius and buffs all his guys with 22 so now he has 33 damage  I am forced to Yogg my turn because my 2nd Brawl was nowhere in sight and my Yogg Pyroblasts me in the face 2 times  I close HS and go to sleep questioning my life choices\", \"commentId\": \"25614\", \"commentDate\": \"1473364329\"}, {\"comment\": \"I hate bullshit shaman decks  Constant buffing of undercosted minions that thrall just easily vomits onto the field  Just when you think you got him lol no bloodlust rockbiterx2 AND THE FUCKING AIDS OF TUSKARR TOTEMIC INTO FUCKING TOTEM GOLEM WHY IS THAT A POSSIBILITY That should never happen only basic totems should be possible Ugh Its so hard to play tempo rogue against shaman when he can beat by turn 4 TURN 4 That shouldnt be possible with any deck  Game 2 OTK warrior that gets his whole combo plus thaurissan by turn 8  There was literally nothing I could do to stop him  I had him down to 2 hp and I was smorcing as best as a rogue could do Its unbelievable how stupid blizzard could be  Dont put OTKs in the game if I cant put a tech card in my deck to hold them off  We need a loatheb back
