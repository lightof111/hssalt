questions What are the odd of hunters adding savannah highmane with kings elekk and having both call of the wilds in their hands without card draw From my experience  the chance is 85 which doesnt make any sense and I will explain why  For the savannah highmane case  hunters play around 15 to 17 low cost minions  by low cost I mean 4 mana or below  how come 85 of the time they pull savannah highmane that doesnt make any sense  For the call of the wild case  hunters have no draw power beside Tracking which is like a one off in hunter decks and Quick Shot is very situational and used mainly for clearing minions or on face  So how come they have both on turn 8 and 9 most of the time they didnt even go through half their decks by that time  I swear this is suspicious  in such a game where you cant add specific cards to your hand and hunters barely even draw using spells minions this is not possible\", \"commentId\": \"22979\", \"commentDate\": \"1469140084\"}, {\"comment\": \"Who

coin or two and I cant stop it  I know what to play around  I bait out Executes and its still just a count down to lose  That deck is single handedly ruining this game for me cause SO MANY PEOPLE ARE

other hand pulling  the only six drop you have in the entire deck  from a deck filled with low cost minions on turn 2 or turn 3 should be around 30 or lower not 80 and higher  you said it yourself  Ive gotten highmane from an elekk tons of times that defies logic even for something that supposed to be random  random doesnt have this very high chance of pulling this same card so many times in different matches between players  You can get very lucky and get both call of the wilds  but the thing is I dont think every hunter player is as lucky as you are and they all have two call of the wild on turn 8 and 9\", \"commentId\": \"22984\", \"commentDate\": \"1469148315\"}, {\"comment\": \"Well when I do happen to have both Call of the Wilds in my hand  which is not often  it obviously hinders my early game quite significantly  The vast majority of my games I do actually draw most of my 4 mana or under minions as a midrange hunter  which is logically consistent   Midrange does use 2x highmanes and also 2x stranglethorn tigers 5 mana or ram wranglers also 5 mana  I also have huhuran in my deck  so its balanced between early  middle  and late game   Yes  I did say Ive drawn highmane from elekk a lot  but in the grand scheme of things Ive played hundreds of games as hunter  that would be in the minority of cases  So nothing that defies logic is going on here  at least for me\", \"commentId\": \"22985\", \"commentDate\": \"1469151032\"}, {\"comment\": \"Hey cuntbag  you do realize that before pros could be successful deck makers they had to netdeck to learn the game

of them would suddenly have a place in a meta that nowadays is entirely dominated by zoolocks  combo renolocks  face shamans  notsoface shamans  midrange hunter and hordes and hordes and hordes of

crafting decks on its own  Even your simplest decks had a synergy and a lot of theorycraft behind it  and still has to these days  Creating a deck isnt just mixing a blind random amount of cards into it  What Im saying is we get down to some point that choices rely less on creating the deck and more into personal tryouts  I can guarantee to you that internet has almost every deck that is possible to create  The point is when you want to be a good player and climb up the hills  most of cards youll pick will just be the same of most players pick  This happens in every single card game I know  Of course you can try some crazy experiment to prove to everyone that youre capable to reach legend with Astral Communion Tokens Druid  but the core of this tryout will HAVE to rely on key cards  Copying those core cards instead of discovering it isnt romantic  but its pragmatic  Just that  Its like it is   And sorry for that weird bold letters  it seems that I cannot unbold them seems bugged here

not good enough to build my own stuff and also spend not enough time in this game to experiment new decks  But I also like to netdeck things I dont find everywhere  because during all the time I found out there were some deck archetypes I really liked and want to play control rogue  token druid  patron warrior  handlock     while there are others I just dont wanna touch because I think theyre boring or something worse most warrior decks  CThun druid  zoolock  face shaman     I cant understand how it is that so many people just netdeck what is more popular  it cant be that everybody loved
