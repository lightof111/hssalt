supposed to be random I think not   i que up as priest supposed to be the least played class on the ladder atm  face two priests swap to warlock face two warlocks swap to shaman same thing I mean WTF It doesn t seem random to me  if it truly were random the event of facing two of the same class in a row while swapping class three times would be like 1 in a 100 this was primetime sunday plays too so not some obscure nighttime playing  It s fucking rigged bet there truly is a higher chance of getting matched vs an opponent of the same email protected CDATA functiont e r n c a ptrytdocument

battlecry deal 2 damage is amazing It just makes cthun king of standard  and all these bull crap class cards that are overpowered and just decent without the cthun synergy   a  6 mana 57 taunt is good  a 45 thats becomes a 410 is just stupid  I know it depends of cthun  but it is baby easy to buff him to a 1010 by turn 4 with a 2 mana 23 that gives him 22   and a 9 mana 44 body assassinate that adds that attack to the dumb cthun is silly   and they are soo boring  whats the fun of buffing one minion It is a stupid OTK No skill in just rolling in a perfect curve with amazing stated minions and dropping a 1515 minion that kills you on turn 10   I cant get any good control decks to function is this dumb standard mode and wild is even more RNG  what happen to the fun the first few weeks of WOTOG was sooo amazing and now it boring but is just aggro and cthun and no new ideas the time with LOE was fun as reno could work a charm  now i am dead by turn 5 to shamans   i am so sad as i love hearthstone  it is my all time favorite game  why cant they promote more midrange or control cards that dont just have to buff a ten mana monster or be a 4 mana 77 i would love a 3 mana 34 for priest or a dragon for warrior not a crappy cthun minion   sorry i had to get that out of my system XD thanks\", \"commentId\": \"21535\", \"commentDate\": \"1465829050\"}, {\"comment\": \"unbelievable
