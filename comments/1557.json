people 9 minutes who dont want to  Hotform plays greedy Reno control mage Hotform faces aggro Shaman Shaman draws really well   Almost the nuts  Hotform whines and cries as I already said before watching the video  because he whines and cries every time he plays an aggro deck so I was vindicated because his greedy control deck gets outtempoed by an aggro deck in the early turns lol Does the lazy thing and jumps on the whaa Shaman too OP bandwagon  despite the fact he whines and cries about pirate warrior too  In fact Ill say it again  Hotform whines and cries every time he faces an aggro deck on stream   Instead of talking about how other classes and archetypes need to be raised up  he takes the lazy way out and blames everything on Shaman  Just butthurt antiaggro players piping in
