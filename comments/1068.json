beneficial to the player who played it  Did they make changes to Yoggs odds Dont get me wrong  this is not a huge problem  but its really annoying when climbing the ladder to lose your winstreak to

difficulties  After that i started facing the true heroes of this game the people who think they are good   the ones whom blizzard gives the perfect hand every game cuz its just fair to give the low cost deck the card advantage  Like seriously fuck you blizzard everyone knows you do that  Have you guys ever faced a shaman who didnt open with tunnel trogg or smth else that op  Or like warlocks never get doomguard   po   sea giant and other high cost minions in their starting hands  but its fucking perfectly fine for priests to get shadow word death   entomb  nzoth and sylvanas in their starting hands  Turn 4 at 16 hp  And the fuck is that bullshit card Po it trades to everything with shitty minions   It fucking trades to tirion  8 Mana Tirion Fordring   the only living person of Azeroth with the purity to cleanse the corrupted Ashbringer   destroyer of Frostmourne  killer of The Fucking Lich King dies to a 11  Oh and btw after i i fell into oblivion after losing 5 times in a row to cancer decks i said fuck it ill play shaman  And ofc i even knew it I was gonna face Control Warrior for sure   Guess what I did D  Btw the only decks Ive beaten with Nzoth priest are Nzoth Paladins and Mages  EVerything else is just concede just so that you dont waste your time dealing with wankers who want to emote you  Its just a waste of time  This game used to be much better  Only problem was Face hunter  Thats all we had to deal with  I fucking miss Handlock so much  I fucking wanna see these retards emote me when 2 88s with taunt and a jaraxus on the back is the opponent  That was what i played for now its just bullshit  5 mana holy nova doesnt board clear  6 mana equality concecrate doesnt clear  I dont even understand why we have board clear cards in this game when all they are useful for is arena  Oh btw Doomhammer  Yeah that card is balanced  5 mana 16 dmg  It should overload for 5  If they play doomhammer they are ata fucking clear advantage in every situation  Might as well make the card unplayabale cuz its fucking dumb  Like you fucking made blade furry unplayable you little shits  Rouge was the coolest class ever and you made it shit  Druid doesnt have a win condition anymore  Hunter gets more op cards cuz we know blizzard lovesface  If i ever meetsomeone from blizzard ill just throw something at their face  Oh Im sorry did that hurt  Most of the enjoyment i get from this game is watching videos on youtube  I mean who the fuck ever watched a shaman  hunter or zoolock video on youtube and was like holy shit well played man  Like theres no wrong play in those decks  there might be but most of the time they dont even care what they drop cuz they have more shit to drop  Lethal at turn 7 well played  You didnt even do shit all u did was hit my face turn after turn ignoring everything on board not even playing just dropping something and choosing one target all game long  I mean there was a fucking warlock who was targeting my fucking face when i played a taunt  Anyways this is a childrens game so it has to be dumb  I enjyoed playing my neptulon shaman back in the day  Now i had to fucking disenchant neptulon  I wonder if blizzard ever gets any good feedback cuz right now this game is even worse than leauge the cancer of cancer\", \"commentId\": \"22300\", \"commentDate\": \"1467516646\"}, {\"comment\": \"Wow  I meant
