play some games and check 1st  if warriors and hunters are out  the only deck they can farm is quest rogues  they lost to most otger decks  On 1st chance you should make one more meta deck that beats

had some games where i had only spells in hand although it is 630 cards spells in the deck    I just start games to concede    such a waste of time    Ah wait i forget my last game where my opponent got Kalimos  Primal Lord 3 fucking times  which was the reason he won against my Questwarrior     It got even that worse  that i am starting to work in my free time instead of playing Hearthstone
