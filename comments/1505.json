Chows  even as far as MULTIPLE Feral Spirits and Hexes  Yet when im in arena I fight a face hunter who manages to kill me  and then the game forces me to fight through another hoarde of Facetards in a row until I beat one  with a seemingly impossibly bad mulligan may I add  I know im not that good at Arena but that was some BS on another level    Thanks for the 23 \", \"commentId\": \"31616\",

before charge was nerfed to that list too  except that deck did take a reasonable amount of skill  Fact is Brode and his team drop a bunch of broken cards  watch them get out of control while they maximise income from sales of the relevant expansion or adventure  then when things become embarrassing  fix the broken cards     and then repeat the cycle  For me this ruins seasons because I just dont enjoy playing decks with synergies that lift them sooo far above everything else  and its boring trying to ladder when after a while all you see is the same handful decks again and again  At some point on a ladder game I accept its inevitable that youll end up facing the stable of effective and highly tuned netdecks  but these days the meta deck effect is obvious in casual and both ladders from rank 20 up  Cant be escaped and dictates that you play an equally OP counter or tech your deck to hell and hope the cancer playing opponent gets a bad draw  So  Fuck Brode and Pirate deck players
