as a tech against Pirates  But I did not face pirates anymore or at least not very much and murlocs was a much bigger problem to me  Therefore  I swapped my Crawler for a Hungry Crab  Three games in a row Ive faced Pirates  and no murlocs D I won them anyway but dammit it bothers me   EditMake it 4 games against Pirates since I removed Golakka Crawler D Still won them all but its kind of annoying\", \"commentId\": \"37414\", \"commentDate\": \"1494875979\"}, {\"comment\": \"salty person  coming through seriously  when will this QR BS ever end how does every QR have a prep against me bouncing minions resolves in a tempo loss  my ass  getting board dominance the turn after you play the quest strongly nullifies any tempo loss this deck should seriously get nerfed  dont know how  but making it an Enchantment wo using Preparation will be a good start this doesnt happen ONLY  when i play control shaman or greedy priest  but with every deck i make  that doesnt kill my opponent on turn 5 or 6  dies stupidly to a broken quest leave 5\", \"commentId\": \"37415\", \"commentDate\": \"1494876745\"}, {\"comment\": \"I am a little fed up so I will rant up a bit   First thing first  as a F2P player  fuck this expansion  Yes  it has a really enjoyable meta  it has really nice cards and all  But Cant play Taunt Warrior because I dont have the quest  cant play Quest Rogue because I dont have the quest  cant play OTK Mage because I dont have the quest  cant play Elemental Shaman because I dont have the Kalimos  and the list goes on     When you put budget problems aside  even when I decide to play a Nzoth Control stuff  all my shit gets transform removed and that triggers me so much  Its like out of 10 games  6 games I got rushed down by a Quest Rogue  Token Druid  Secret Mage  Midrange Hunter  Pirate Warrior etc  which makes Nzoth useless  3 games Shamans and Mages uses their unlimited amount of transform removals which makes Nzoth useless  And that last game you face a Taunt Warrior which you MAY get a chance to use your Nzoth but who you are kidding  I have no problems with aggro decks what so ever but the card I base my deck around having no purpose is a joke   My other rant will be on that stupid spell called Ice Block  Your Medivhs Valets are always active which means they are absolutely INSANELY powerful  You no longer sweat to draw it  Arcanologist does that for you  If you still somehow fail  Babbling Books  Primordial Glyphs and Cabalists Tomes got your back  While its on the board  you dont have to worry about board any more  if it gets too out of control you can just Flamestrike  And while it stays on the field waiting for you to be popped on god knows which turn  all you have to do is just throw some burn spells at them and make sure they have lower than 10 life so you can just Pyroblast them granting you the easiest win ever  I can not understand you people  Playing aggro deads are braindead but playing a deck that all it does is hiding behind an Ice block and burning the opponent while doing so requires skill Cut me some slack dude   So I want to finish by saying a big Fuck you to all Shamans  Freeze Mages Secret Mage is fine

answer from a Babbling Book  Primordial Glyph or Cabalists Tome  And this is not fun at all  when you dont have a chance to win  and defeated by randomly generated spells  Also worth to mention a game
