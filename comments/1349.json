and when he is out of cards and I am at 9 life and hoping to draw either one of my Healing Waves or Hallazeal he draws Barnes  plays it  gets Rag  pings my face and Rag finishes me off even with 4 minions on my side of the field  Astral Communion Druid plays Coin  Innvervate  Astral Communion on turn 1 and proceeds with Ysera on turn 2  followed by Kraken and Rag  Game over for me  Ramp Druid plays Barnes on 4  gets YShaarj  which in turn puts Bog Creeper for free on the field  I have no way to kill either the Creeper or the 11 YShaarj  Game over for me  I have 13 life with 3 taunts in my board  Face Warrior is at 13 life and very dead next turn  The Warrior hits one of my taunts with Axe  hits me for 12 with both Mortal Strikes  plays Flame Juggler and the Juggler pings my face when I have 6 minions on my side of the field   Tempo Mage gets Polymorph from Babbling Book and uses it on my Highmane  My Rag later misses a 5050 on his Rag and he uses the 2nd Babbling Book and gets   another Polymorph  What a lovely day to play HS indeed\", \"commentId\": \"28287\", \"commentDate\": \"1480015455\"}, {\"comment\": \"Return the dobloons you stole from their cursed chest\",

this game and making it awful  If it wasnt for the prospects of the new expansion I would stop playing right now   Blizzard has obviously held off on changing shaman because of the new set but if the new set doesnt fix this completely and udderly ridiculous unbalanced class Im quitting   I cant enjoy any variety with this toxic sludge contaminating what is otherwise a great game    Kay done

time you just get ahead and SEND FACE  FACE FACE FACE  Then the other player desperately tries to clear your board every single turn  The second he cant  you win by ignoring all his plays and just going face Its so shitty  Back to watching Kripp complain now lol  Watching streamers get owned by noob  bad RNG and stupid game design The true way to experience hearthstone\", \"commentId\":

BLIZZARD  they just let you lose  And yes they do because when you lose you are going to buy content  And this game is a company in it for profit not to let us play a fun game  The RNG proves my point time after time  I just played 15 games i have lost every simple game because of bad RNG  15 games just because my opponent had every answer in his hand  Just look at those odds  This good be a fun
