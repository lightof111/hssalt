them  I dont worry too much  I can usually get around the 13 legendaries that will result   Pretty standard first 4 turns  I have some totems and some cthuun buffers out  Twilight elder has been out since turn 2 I coined him in and I have some board control  but he has Moroes putting out a 11 each turn  I coax out a polymorph with a frostwolf 66  All good  Turn 6  I dont have minion draw so I totem and get some hero damage instead of attacking the stewards  Turn 7  He uses a flame Lance and hero power to pretty much clear my side  I throw out a totem and end turn  He gets some light her damage and summons    I forget its name  its a 34 and it does 2 random damage when ever a spell is cast  I cant deal with it but have enough health to wait out a few turns  I summon another toten   and a flame totem to give two of my totems some attack to clear a few stewards and get healed after   Then  Turn 9  It happens  He flamestrikes and clears my side completely  Then    he summons Skycapn Kragg  With no pirates on the board  He somehow used two 7 mana cards on the same turn  and still used his hero power  I couldnt deal with it and lost  I was probably going to lose either way
