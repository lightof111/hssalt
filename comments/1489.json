against the hordes of Shamans and Rogues  30 min games vs Reno decks  is nothing but awful  Druid has 1 viable deck  and its Jade Druid  The ultimate curve deck  if you dont get early rampgolem spawners  pray for early removal against the PirateShaman openers  you get nothing of this by turn 3  just hit the concede button  But thats all druid has Its just not fun anymore  Ladder feels like playing the same 2 games over and over  The one versus Reno  and the one versus Pirate  No variety in either ladder  or decks  Meanwhile Blizzard keeps on going with the We are closing monitoring shamanbla bla  its been the dominant Tier 1 deck since Karazhan  When we finally get a nerf  its for Rockbiter  Wow  We are trying to promote class diversity blablabla by adding more snowballing 1drop neutrals   I cant believe that the same people who made League of Explorers are the ones who designed Karazhan and msog  how is a decline like that even possible\", \"commentId\": \"31258\",

uninstalling again  The worst is I won all but two of them  Which  at rank 2017  wasnt that hard though   but it was just so much unadulterated bullsht  Both won and lost games  that by the time I had done my second quest I was fed up with stupidly braindead yet completely broken cards and RNG  The stupidly braindead yet completely broken applies to both   Ill keep to games where thinking and

started on what patches and buccaneer has done to both wild and standard also            going back to magic cards  fuck you team 5  you ruined hearthstone it was already pretty bad before msog\",
