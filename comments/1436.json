am currently of the opinion that Hearthstone devs are not very good card game designers  based on the shocking imbalance Ive experienced in the game  Ive made it to rank 5 this morning and I figured  lets analyze the 36 games I played over Christmas  Turns out  out of these 36 I faced 8 pirate warriors and 6 aggro shamans  yes  thats close to 39 of Patches  Inc  I saw 7 Renolocks 19  5 midrange shamans 14  3 dragon priests  a miracle rogue and then some weirdness dragon warrior  ramp druid  Nzoth pally  Renomage  Renopriest  control warrior  That means that 39 was pure aggro  and 42 decks that counter these aggro decks Renolock  dragon priest plus Im graciously putting midrange shaman in the counter also leaving dragon warrior out of the dichotomy  I played most deck types myself  This season  27 aggro shaman  27 pirate warrior  23 dragon Reno priest  28 jade druid  28 Jademidrange shaman  23 dragon warrior  5 control warrior   9 handbuff hunter very early season D and then some miscellaneous experimentation  My winrates With the curvestoneSMOrcdecks that require laughably little skill  I maintained a winrate of 67 and 70  With the Jade druid early season 60  And my Reno dragon priest  the one I consider the OhgodanotheraggroopponentIknowImsupposedtocounterthisbutletsjusttrytosurvive  intelligent deck  I got 48  For what its worth  happy feast of Winterveil  fellow

disenchant most of my cards and voila    i became a face hunter player  so i guess we should actually give these guys a break     not everyone can afford multilegendary control decks\", \"commentId\":

easily but the designers are nuclear levels of terrible  I wouldnt hold my breath for them to do anything though  These are the people who made Guac Boy happen  This is the team of geniuses that took 2 years to balance Patches It shouldnt even be legal for any of them to go outside without adult supervision but there you go  they are in charge of a multimillion dollar proprety and no one will kick their asses off of it until it starts to lose money  This is basically the George Lucas situation lol  Someone needs to take this game out of their hands but theyre afraid to do it because its worked

basically with the rest you said  Although this salt thread sometimes goes overboard on wishing other players nasty things Im convinced Hearthstones player base is keeping it alive  more than the expansions  Lets just say its complicated D  At any rate  the past expansions have not shown any indications that the devs are actually any good  in my lessandless humble opinion    Also  totally this  PLUS playing aggro  with this card pool and meta  simply is the most efficient for climbing ladder which  sadly  does not equal having fun  It yields highest winrates and shortest game time per match

your deck and cards  I would be so annoyed  I already kind of dislike having other people going through my stuff  Always irritates me Its just one mechanic that simply isnt fun  And of course  in most
